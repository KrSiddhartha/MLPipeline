I took out a {$5000.00} loan with XXXX XXXX back in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX for my attendance at University XXXX XXXX. Once I started repayment on them my loan has increased to almost {$10.00}. So I accumulated double in interest. How is this possible. I went back to school and deferred my loans which was until XX/XX/XXXX. By this time navient has now taken over my student loans. I was n't advised of the change. I 've to one person in regards to my account and they say I owe {$300.00}. which I was only pay {$100.00}. They have been calling me nonstop all day. I do not want to speak to them unless someone is willing to help. No one is willing they only want there money. Why is my interest so high? Why are n't you trying to help me lower my monthly payment. why is the interest that much on a college student.,Student loan

"On XX/XX/2017 I deposited a check into my savings account with the understanding that there would be a hold to confirm if its a valid check. I deposited at the branch of People 's United Bank located in XXXX XXXX, CT on XXXX XXXX through the ATM. NO CASH WAS WITHDRAWN ON THIS ACCOUNT. I later received a direct deposit in my CHECKING account from my monthly annuity. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from the bank with a photo of the company check drawn on a out of state bank telling me the account was closed so the check was not valid. On XX/XX/2017 I present to the branch and questioned why my CHECKING ACCOUNT was frozen and my debit card cancelled. The branch manager ; XXXX XXXX XXXX said it was a fraudulent check and their loss prevention department said close the accounts. XXXX XXXX relayed to me that I would not be able to open an account anywhere because I am now looked at as being a fraudulent depositor and it will be reported to XXXX. He advised me to go open another account at a different bank ( i.e ) XXXX XXXX before he closes the People 's Bank accounts. I asked him how can it be fraud if no funds were withdrawn and the purpose of my depositing the check into my savings was for the purpose of being classified as fraud. Today, XX/XX/2017 my funds into my checking account have not been released and i was refused to contact Loss-Prevention to further remedy this problem. 
I would like this matter to be resolved and not flagg as a fraudulent bank depositor and not report me to XXXX.","Bank account or service, Savings account"
"I have two complaints. 
1. ) XX/XX/XXXX we were contacted by Navient about consolidating our loans. We were told at that time that they would use the lowest interest rate of the loans which was around 5.3 %. When the paperwork was complete they used the highest interest rate which was 7.75 %. When I called to complain they said "" I 'm sorry that the person told you that but this is what it is and nothing can be done '' :!! 
2. ) XX/XX/XXXX our checking account was compromised and we had to open a new one. I went online to Navient 3 weeks prior to the payment being due to change the bank account information. I noticed the payment did not come out on the first and called to inquire about it. The operator said that I must have changed the account too late in the month and the payment wont come out. I told him that I changed it 3 weeks prior to the payment date and he said he did n't know what happened but I could skip that month if I wanted to. I said I did NOT want to skip a payment. He said that he would put into the account to pay. He then turned around and skipped that months payment so for the next 5 months we paid nothing but interest on the loan with no principal. Our payments then went up by {$23.00} each month because we "" skipped '' a payment!",Student loan

I don't have any of them as I am in the US on working visa ( was a student before ). The bank representative said that they can not continue with my application. 

In my opinion this is a discrimination based on XXXX XXXX as it was the sole reason they can not give me the card. The bank representative assured me that they don't discriminate and any person can obtain the credit card if they provide copies of requested documents ( yes, that makes total sense to them, go figure ). Well, how about the people who are here on XXXX, XXXX and other visas?

As far as I read about the rules regarding credit card application process, a creditor may take into account applicant 's XXXX XXXX but can not make a decision based solely on that. 

I have successfully obtained multiple credit cards in the past ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ), the last one as recently as XXXX of this year. I have good credit history and excellent credit score. I never had to provide any proves of my XXXX, let alone being denied based on that.

We don't ever block payments to customers bills or credit card. '' For nearly a year, I have been making payments to PayPal and they have been returned by Synchrony Bank. This month has been the most egregious delay in scheduling the payment and getting a notice that the payment was not applied. Regardless of what bank account I pay from, even if I attempt to transfer money from my own PayPal account balance within PayPal,  Synchrony claims the transaction is denied or the payment isn't applied. 

It seems purposefully confusing because notices come from PayPal but payments go through synchrony and synchrony blames it on PayPal and PayPal blames it on synchrony. Synchrony also blames my bank ND my bank says they have no record that there has even been an attempt to put the transactions through. When they do go through, it is applied however Synchrony decides rather than customer interest or special financing purposes. 

Lastly, the late payments and closed account have significantly impacted my credit score and the stress is unnecessary, especially given the times. It's confusing, expensive, and wastes my time.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

"I have been a victim of identity theft. My social security number was fraudulently used to open a prepaid debit card.

Its almost impossible to get though to talk to anyone. As a result I contacted XXXX XXXX to make sure the fraud alert was in place and they would contact the other 2 credit reporting companies.

"Good Morning, I have been a Chase authorized user since for the past 13 years, I first opened my Chase account when I was a XXXX in fact because I had heard amazing stories from my parents about their professionalism, and how they truly cater to those bankers in the neighborhood. One of the best features for me as I got older was Chase Quickpay. It was an amazing tool to use being that I left XXXX to go to college out of state and was able to receive / send money back to my family in XXXX. As I 've gotten older it 's become even more beneficial as I have relocated from my hometown and use the function to send money to my family. Chase had this wonderful option which made me feel safe and secure that if for some reason I typed out an incorrect address or phone number I had a grace period where I can cancel the transaction, and the money would not be deposited into said account. I do n't know who is responsible for the decision making at Chase, but whoever thought it was a great idea to REMOVE that option and AUTOMATICALLY deposit the money into the 2nd parties account, really messed up. I sent a quickpay for {$740.00} to an incorrect address, I noticed immediately it was an incorrect address and notified chase as quick as possible. They said it would take about 3-5 business days to get a response or action on my claim and to keep my eyes peeled to my email address. The 3-5 business days had passed and I 'd yet to hear any thing back from the Bank, I called them myself to follow up and they informed me they would re-file my claim and get back to me. It has been a total of ( 17 ) days since I first filed the claim and I have yet to receive any type of follow up. I called Chase this morning only to be told that "" Oh, well if you have n't heard anything back that means we ca n't help you, we do not have any Quickpay protection it 's up to the consumer to make the right decision. '' Seriously? That is the response I get? After waiting this entire time it took that gentleman 2 seconds to tell me this while the rest of the company has had me in Limbo? How can this be? How can you DELETE a function that protects your VALUED customers and then when an issue arises basically kick them to the curb and inform them that sorry, your money is n't our concern? How is this possible? I just want the situation rectified, I have complied with all of Chase 's demands and needs pertaining to this matter and yet there is nothing they can do at all to rectify the situation? How do you not plan for this or have a system in place to protect your customers.

The assistant conversed with her apparent supervisor and they started that they will look into it. After reviewing my paystubs for that pay period I saw where the judgement had been paid, however I was unable to get to the local office before they closed. 

XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX-I called the office and let them know that I have the evidence that I paid this balance off, and even though the balance appears to have been overpaid, I should not still have this on my credit as an active garnishment, especially 6 years later.

I asked her for the documents showing my judgement release and if I do not receive this proof I will be denied this line of credit. She told me she had one and all the documents are waiting for me. I arrive and I go through the papers, She gave me 2 receipts and the actual judgement paperwork that was filed with the courthouse. I asked for the judgement release. She stated I do not have that, but the documents should be enough.

What also saddens me is the assistant told me that she calls the courthouse daily and they continue to file suits against customers. While she told me this to help assure me that it will be handled within a day or two, I cant help but think, who else are they doing this to, and why wouldn't you fix the customers credits that paid you off?","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

Equifax and XXXX XXXX keep messing up my credit report. They keep launching a investigation every 30 days on the same problem. For 2 months now we have disputed incorrect information regarding XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The account and car was charged off over 3 years ago. And we have already been through this process with XXXX XXXX and even had the CFPB involved years ago.As they violated collection practices. And they continue to report inaccurate information. At first it was a XXXX $ balance as it should be. But they kept reporting late payments for over 3 years after the charge off. Now they went back and fixed the late payments report. But now they say are reporting a balance of XXXX $ on the report. They keep making us wait 30days and its the same account. It has been close to 60 days since this was first reported. And It has been over 30 days. Equifax call center is in the a different country and we ca n't get anywhere with them.

"I hired XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX to move me into my new home on XX/XX/21. I paid a {$170.00} deposit. Upon arrival, the employees walked in and immediately, in an extremely hostile way, were outwardly expressing to each other that their office employees didn't know what they were talking about with sending them to my move. I was obviously confused and when asking what they were talking about, I was told they would be adding thousands of dollars onto my bill. ( I am still unsure why as I was moving out of a small 2 bedroom apartment with only one bed and one couch being the large furniture items. Everything else was boxes - maybe 30 of them. ) I expressed that I didn't want that and would like to hire them only for what I had previously discussed and if they didn't finish within that time frame, then they would just stop wherever they were. They agreed, had me sign some paper that he said he'd go over when he returned, then told me he was going to get tools from him truck and would be right back. He never returned! I immediately called the company, told the manager what happened, her words to me exactly were "" I highly doubt that happened '' then she hung up on me. I was then charged {$550.00} in fraudulent "" cancellation '' charges. The police were called and everything was reported as I had also seen the employees taking photos of my debit card with their personal cell phones. I then called my bank, Wells Fargo, explained the situation, filed a report, and they returned my {$750.00} to me.

"I have a 15 year term 4 % simple interest mortgage loan with Citizens Bank that initiated XX/XX/XXXX. I always paid the monthly loan payments early, frequently by more than a week or so. Until XX/XX/XXXX, the bank provided payment coupons that did not itemize how the payment was applied- interest vs principal. This year, Citizens Bank began providing monthly statements providing a breakdown of interest vs principal. Recently, I happened to review and calculate the bank 's breakdown of interest vs principal on a current monthly statement. I found that the bank had erroneously calculated the breakdown, applying more of the payment to interest ( about {$40.00} or so if my recollection is accurate ) and a correspondingly lesser amount to principal, thus erroneouly overstating the principal balance due after payment was applied. I then went back and reviewed the other statements for this year and found that they all contained erroneous calculations of interest. I contacted the bank, and was told by a representative to "" put a sticky note '' on the statement when paying, disputing their calculation. Finding this resolution unacceptable, I asked to speak with a supervisor. A supervisor reviewed the statement and had no explanation for the improper calculations of interest vs principal. I asked for a review of my account and that the bank send me a print out of my payments and their calculations. Because this is a "" simple interest '' mortgage product, the fact that I would always pay the mortgage payment early, usually substantially so, would result in a payoff sooner than 180 months. It appears that Citizens Bank has been recalculating the interest/principal apportionment to insure that the final payment is not reached until the full 180 month term. I have not received the promised follow up by the bank. I would very much appreciate your investigatingthe bank 's activity re account. In a follow up communication, I can scan in and provide you with copies of the erroneous statements. Citizens Bank 's conduct appears unfair, deceptive and abusive and a violation of the Act.

"I sought consulting services from XXXX XXXX XXXX. The consulting services were supposed to be provided for one year, commencing on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The amount for the 12 months of consulting was {$22000.00} and was paid via American Express credit card. The company provided adequate services in the first month of their consulting service but I grew frustrated with the lack of their advice towards the second month. I have e-mail documentation showing my growing concerns as to our progress. XXXX XXXX, XXXX was the last date of our contact, which is approximately XXXX XXXX months after the services started. 

At this point in time, I terminated the contract as stipulated in Section XXXX of the signed agreement. It notes : "" After at least 3 months of consulting, either party may cancel this consulting Agreement. The cost of {$22000.00} will be prorated based upon the length of consulting services provided, rounded up to the nearest whole month. For example, if consulting services are retained for 6 months and 1 week, the Client 's responsible portion will be 7 months and 5 months will be reimbursed. Repayment will be within thirty days. '' In this situation, the prorated time used would be 3 months, rounded up from 2.5 months and the refund would be for 9 months. {$22000.00} divided into 12 months equals {$1800.00} monthly. Therefore, a refund of 9 months would be : XXXX x {$1800.00} = {$17000.00}. 

The consulting company disagreed with this figure and came back with an amount much lower, without explanation. At this point in time, I relied on the American Express dispute process to resolve the conflict. After the first XXXX disputes, the consulting company agreed to refund {$11000.00} and did so AFTER the date they were supposed only, and only after repeated calls to them from American Express. The consulting company claimed that travel, meals, and lodging expenses had to be deducted from the refund amount. This is in defiance of the agreed-upon contract which clearly states the "" cost of {$22000.00} will be prorated '' and does NOT refer to any reimbursement of expenses. 

Because of the large difference, {$5800.00}, I lodged another dispute with American Express. In the dispute paperwork, I provided copies of : 1 ) the signed contract, 2 ) an e-mail from the owner of the consulting company acknowledging that the "" Client Agreement changes are fine '', referring to the proration clause, and 3 ) several e-mails where I expressed growing concern for the lack of consulting being provided. This dispute was resolved in the merchant 's favor in XXXX XXXX WITHOUT ADEQUATE RESEARCH. 

A response from the merchant stated that "" Extensive follow up occurred until XX/XX/XXXX. '' This was NOT investigated by AMEX and I am directly challenging this statement! 

At no point did the consulting company have ANY contact with me after XXXX XXXX, XXXX until I contacted them to cancel the consulting agreement. If they are claiming to having provided "" extensive follow up '', I demand to see proof such as e-mail correspondence between the myself and the company, phone logs showing sustained contact after XXXX XXXX, XXXX worthy of "" extensive follow up '', or even SMS records.The burden to prove that services were provided from XXXX XXXX, XXXX to the "" XX/XX/XXXX '' falls upon the merchant. I am confident the consulting company will not be able to provide any such proof. 

I 've even attached a screenshot of my e-mail inbox showing that no other emails were received from the consultant after XX/XX/XXXX. 

Despite the consulting company providing airline receipts for flights, the consultant did not follow through with these flights and thus, NO consulting services were provided on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX.",Credit card or prepaid card

I called the toll free number and was told by a computer that I could not place a freeze and to go to the website that told me to phone. You can probably see the issue here. The alternative was to mail a form to the company, but Equifax has no forms or links to forms on its website and no instructions on the phone line. In short, I am unable to freeze my account.

"The summary of this complaint is that my credit card company Capital One, coerced me into making a late payment when I was asking for a due date extension I was entitled to. By giving me incorrect information, not notifying me of my right to extend the due date of my bill by one whole billing cycle and not informing me that my interest rate would be severely affected, the Capital One agent directed me to make a late payment resulting in the interest rate of my account to go up from about 6 % to 23 %. 

On XX/XX/2021, Capital One was contacted to extend due date of the credit card bill. The extension was needed because customer was experiencing Covid-19 hardship issues as well as having his wallet stolen a week earlier which Capital One had been notified about and had issued a new account number since. When asking for just a one week extension, the Capital One agent iterated that there is definitely no way to do that even if I was experiencing financial hardship and had very recently had my wallet stolen. The agent directed me to make my payment late and then call back after to get a {$39.00} fee re-credited. She made no mention at all of the late payment changing the interest rate and insisted that there was no option of extending the due date as was later found possible. 
When the interest rate increase was discovered, Capital One was contacted to get the misunderstanding and mistakes THEY created cleared up. After numerous attempts and hours of trying to communicate with Capital One, eventually they said they would listen to the recorded conversation and get back in touch for resolution. When they contacted me back, they lied and said the agent had not misdirected, misled or given me wrong information so I asked that we listen to the recorded conversation together to confirm their claim. They then said that they are not allowed to let me hear the conversation and gave no actual reason why. The reason was clear ...

To help mitigate the on-going hardship further, I applied and received a one-time only grant from the local XXXX non-profit agency. The amount of the check they gave me to send to PennyMac ( my loan servicer ) is not enough to pay the amount I was in arrears in full but the loan modification would solve that. These funds would help my ( new ) mortgage payment to be covered for the next 6 months while I rebound financially. I am earning less than half of what I was earning prior to COVID. 

Even though the funds are not from the HHF program and I am not in a program that makes my mortgage payment for me on a continual on-going basis, PennyMac halted my loan modification and coded my account to HHF. They are unresponsive to my many, many phone calls and emails trying to understand what is going on and why this one grant amount would negate the loan modification agreement. They are completely unresponsive and say that I can only speak to one individual for answers to question because my account with PennyMac is coded as "" HHF ''. They will not give me any answers about my loan modification or the rules in using another mortgage assistance source.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase HELOC for options to lower payment from {$770.00} I was told I could unlock my XXXX % interest rate to XXXX % and I would have to pay an unlocking fee in the amount of {$1000.00} which was XXXX % of the original loan {$100000.00}. 
I asked if I did the unlocking what would my new payment be going forward and I was told {$530.00}. 
I then asked to have the form faxed to me and to be transferred to the refinance department. 
I did not follow through in returning the documents at that time. 
The month of XXXX I called Chase to request the unlocking documents again and I was again informed about the unlocking fee of XXXX % of the original loan.

After a few weeks I called back to inquire about the documents I was promised and was sent to a local branch to retrieve them. 
XX/XX/XXXX I signed and faxed to Chase the unlocking document. 
Based on a letter I received from Chase explaining I would be able to draw from the HELOC I called to inquire about that and was told I could not draw because I had filed bankruptcy and when I refuted that information I was then told my home value had decreased. At that time I asked to speak to a manager who also stated my home value would not allow me to draw from the HELOC, however, she would check the appraisal system and get back to me. That was an epic fail because she made several attempts to call my home phone while I was out of the country even though she was given an alternate number to reach me and she never answered her phone when I called her. 
While still out of the country I logged on the Chase 's website and it indicated my XXXX payment will be {$2000.00} I immediately called Chase and told them do not deduct any more than the original amount of {$770.00} from my account until this matter can be cleared up. 
I called again and was told after some research I would get a call back in two days even though I was out of the country. That person called me back and put me through to XXXX. I told XXXX I did not want to go forward with the unlocking and do not deduct the {$1000.00} unlocking fee from my account and she told me it was too late to stop it from being deducted but they can refund it. The call disconnected, she did not call me back and I did not know how to reach her. 
Once I returned home I spoke to a Rep who read to me the notes XXXX left and said it ended with her stating the {$1000.00} will be refunded. He put me through to escalations and of course they were going to do another research and call me back. 
Finally my wife called and asked for the president 's office and was transferred to XXXX in escalations who did more research and called my wife back to say the initial conversation I had with Chase XX/XX/XXXX indicated the Rep explained to me XX/XX/XXXX will be the draw period and my payment will be {$540.00}.

( Federal Offset MyStudentData Download ) One of the loans listed was a Perkins loan directly with XXXX University. 
The loan was listed as defaulted. 
I contacted XXXX University, who sent a document confirming that the debt had been paid in full. 
That loan is now listed as Paid in Full. 

I also found a box of bank statements from XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. ( they were with old tax returns that I had no idea I had. These were the only ones I found ). In these statements were cancelled checks paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for these loans. ( Federal Offset Cancelled Checks Summary, Federal Offset Cancelled Checks1, Federal Offset Cancelled Checks2 ). In XX/XX/XXXX, banks stopped returning cancelled checks, I do not have any statements beyond these ( with the exception of recent online accounts ). 
The cancelled checks for the Perkins Loan with XXXX University totalled {$1900.00}. 
The cancelled checks for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loan totalled {$3900.00}. 
There were absolutely additional payments made, but these are the only statements that I happened to find. 
( I dont keep documents for 30 years, I dont know anyone who does? ). 

I tried to contact XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, but they are apparently no longer in business. 
( the IRS confirmed this. ) I believe part of this stems from my fathers death ( 10 years ago ). 
On my birth certificate Im XXXX XXXX XXXX On my drivers license Im XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX wasnt available on my license at the time I received it ) On my social security card Im XXXX XXXX. 

When my father passed away, XXXX XXXX declared me DEAD. 
Apparently, when you die, any credit you have open is, at minimum, tripled, and written off. 
( XXXX XXXX more than tripled it, and sold it to at least 5 collection agencies before writing it off ). 
I didnt realize what had happened until I tried to buy a car ( 2 months after his death ). 
I was told that they would love to sell me the car, but I was deceased. 
When I got my credit report, every balance I had was at minimum tripled and written off. 
I had to go to The Social Security Administration to prove I was still alive, and in fact, it was my father who had passed away. 

It took years to pay, and cancel cards. My credit score went down over 250 points. 
Example : I had a XXXX card that I owed approximately {$100.00} My report said almost {$400.00}, deceased. ( I called, told them I was alive, they said I owed them {$100.00} ) I paid {$100.00} and cancelled the card. 
Nearly the same numbers with a XXXX card. 
XXXX XXXX was listed with at least 5 collection agencies at more than 4 times the amount owed. 
Approximately 5 years ago I received a letter from the IRS stating that XXXX XXXX had forgiven the debt I owed them ( over {$5000.00} ), and I had to pay tax on the debt ( over {$1000.00} ), as it was now considered income. 

Every time I have to buy a new car ( mine had XXXX miles ), that requires a credit report. This same kind of thing happens. Its a Total Nightmare.

I got a personal installment loan with citizens one bank for the new XXXX. I went to pay off the full balance of the loan on the phone and I find after I made the payment with the supervisor XXXX that I was charged twice with each amount being {$1300.00} for a total of over a {$2000.00} charge on my credit card. I had to use my credit card to pay off other balances and could not do so because the overcharge of two payments reduced my credit line needed to pay off other balances. The supervisor did not tell me the first payment did not go through which took away my choice to tell her to not make an additional payment effort after the first payment did not go through. Instead she just kept charging my credit card without notifying me and when I get off the phone I see two charges on my credit card. After two weeks of waiting going back and forth with multiple supervisors I asked that they give me a discretionary credit on my credit card for all the issues as well as to compensate for the interest accrued on other balances that I could have paid off using my credit limit that they reduced by charging me twice. The bank didnt even make an effort to reverse the second charge as it was on my account for 8 days. For eight days I did not have the credit limit I needed to pay off other obligations due to them charging me twice while interest was acrruing daily on the other obligations. The supervisors escalated this matter to the office of the chair and the end resolution is that they were not going to give me a discretionary credit for all the issues they caused. I spoke to a lady named XXXX. I told her I was going to report them to the CFPB because many other customers may be going through the same thing. Two days later I get a call from the dispute resolutions department to check up on me because they heard I was going to the CFPB and they tried to ensure they werent going to give me a credit but they would better their process.,"Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"
"My complaint is that Regions Bank conducts fraudulent business practices, specifically reordering of transactions and giving fraudulent account balance information. Also the Practice of Charging overdrafts on pending charges. I had a positive balance in account as of XX/XX/2018, made several transactions from account. Checked balance on the online bankling which showed positive balance after those transactions. Made an ATM withdraw which put account into negative status and understandably incurred one overdraft fee. Had a direct Deposit that would cover the one ATM charge that should have posted at midnight. Checked account onXX/XX/18 to find transactions reordered which cause my account to incur multiple overdraft fees instead of one fee. This is the second time this has happened.

See conversation below for previous dates.

] > XXXX, Thank you for your response. My name is XXXX and I will be happy to assist you. 



I apologize for any inconvenience that this matter may have caused you. When a purchase or withdrawal is made with a CheckCard,  those funds are immediately held ( or "" frozen '' ). Purchases made with a CheckCard have been guaranteed to that merchant and represent goods or services that have already been received. This means that during processing each night, there must be enough funds available in the account to cover the items that are posting and the items that are still pending. 

The balance in the account before posting on XX/XX/2018 was {$19.00}. There was 2 transaction pending ( holding ) for {$16.00} and a deposit of {$35.00}, which left an available balance of {$38.00} for us to pay the items posting to your account that night.

There were then 4 items presented for payment on the account totaling {$40.00}. We paid the items for you, but the account was charged the overdraft fee since the funds were not available to pay one of the items. Even though the funds were in the account, they were not available since they had been guaranteed to other merchants for the pending items. 

I know this can be complicated. To make things easier to understand, we provide a breakdown of your balance on this date ( or the date of any overdraft occurrence ), from your Account Details screen. All you have to do is click the green fee name in the description column. This will allow you to view the Overdraft Notice.

While we understand that your Online Banking, Mobile Banking, and alerts are wonderful tools that assist you with your financial needs, we are unable to guarantee the alerts or balances will be made and reflect in "" real-time ''. This is due to a number of factors which can cause delays such as service provider or carrier outages, merchant/bank processing, inbox filters, etc. Because of this, the only way to know what the true available balance in your account is, is by keeping a written log of all transactions and deposits for each account.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

"We were recently the victim of credit card fraud. 

We are writing to dispute several fraudulent charges on our account in the amounts of {$13000.00} during XX/XX/2021 and XX/XX/2021. We received the letter from TD Bank Disputes & Claims, where you expressed our claim investigation determined that fraud did not occur. We really disagreed with the decision taken and for this reason, we are requesting that you investigate these charges and take the necessary time to investigate all the transactions disputed and denied. 
We are a small family own company, and our business account expenses are only related to the company needs, every month we have the same expenses same places related to landscaping and we have only one debit card in our possession all the time and we operate out of XXXX Fl. 
We asked to please call us and ask any question that helps to resolve our claim, look at our accounts transactions from the previous year, and there are no records of any of those online transactions or phone app transactions, there are card transactions in different places at the same time, meaning while we are in XXXX shopping for the business the card is being used up north at a hotel or a kid dance school. We as a person or company do not have any records of claims related to banks ' fraudulent transactions file in our past. Our records are clean of anything related to bank fraudulent issues. 

The odd thing is that my card was definitely never out of our possession, yet the transactions were made with chip and pin as the claim responded on the last denial. We encourage the claim and bank like 20 times via email to take a closer look at the charges and while we were in XXXX shopping for the business the card was being used somewhere else. We have heard of sophisticated software in card machines that can extract this information to make hard copies, and we guess that this happened to us. 

However, based on the bank denial some of the transactions were chip/pin, TD Visa has been largely unwilling to remove our charges. Then how come the bank never investigated by calling and asking questions or searching for our history as a citizen, previous fraudulent cases filed, etc.? Why even with a police report the bank or claim department had not requested any surveillance records, electronic tracking of where we were at the time the card was used? Why you the bank have not to look from XXXX back to the date the account was opened to see we never used the card in such personal places and online shopping? We have provided everything we can think can help the case and we have not received any call, or investigation that had been done only received denial without explanations. 

TD claims that their technology is 'so advanced ' that they would know if any existing copies of my card were used, but we assumed they do not time for our small claim. 

But because this is legally a minor theft, compared to probably what they have on their desk, I feel the case will not be given much attention. 

But for us as small family own business is our life, our work for hours and no weekends off. Our future, our kids ' future! So, it is more than important for us, and we will go as far as it is needed to get our money back. We have been treated like criminals through every step of this process.

"I am writing to complain about ineffective and deceptive banking services provided by Citibank : Citibank enrolled me in Checking Plus, a deceptive and predatory product ; provided me inadequate assistance when I indicated concern about my account ; provided me notices in a language I do not understand ; and failed to investigate fraud I suspected occurred on my account. 
In or around XX/XX/XXXX I noticed on my statement that I was enrolled in a product called Checking Plus ( "" CP '' ) and that it appeared I had taken out a {$3200.00} loan. I did not recall consenting to the opening of the CP account, so I went to XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my local Citibank, to inquire about CP. The branch employee told me that CP was merely a loan offer. I understood CP to be a conventional loan, and I thought I would have to request money at a branch to utilize CP. The bank employee did not explain that Citibank would automatically transfer money to my checking account if I had a negative balance, or that I would be charged fees and interest without prior notice from Citibank. 
I told the representative that I only spoke XXXX, and I plainly brought in a statement in English. Citibank did not offer to provide XXXX notices at this time. During the next three years, I continued to reach out in XXXX about problems with my accounts and request statements in XXXX -- both via phone and at my local branch -- but I was never offered XXXX statements or notices. The bank 's failure to provide information in XXXX has made it impossible to fully understand my accounts or address my concerns with the bank. 
During the next two years, I continued to bank as I had in the past. But because I was misinformed about how CP worked, I accumulated at least {$260.00} in fees and {$3400.00} in debt-at least {$630.00} of this amount in interest. Because my paycheck is deposited on Fridays, on Saturdays I would check my balance and then withdraw funds from my checking account for the upcoming week at my local branch ATM. I would never withdraw more than the displayed balance. With legal help, I recently learned that an automatic {$50.00} transfer to my saving account processed on Monday morning would overdraw my checking account. Instead of notifying me of the negative balance, Citibank automatically borrowed {$100.00} from the CP account at a 18.25 % interest rate and charged a {$10.00} fee. 
Each month I reviewed my statement to ensure my account balances looked correct. Because the fees and loan payments often neared the amount lent from CP to my checking account, I did not realize that I was borrowing money. But between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with Citibank representatives multiple times about the CP account because I was concerned after reviewing my statements. I was assured multiple times that CP was merely money that was available for me to use, even though all along I was actively borrowing money. Nobody explained that Citibank had already transferred money to my checking account, charged me fees, or made automatic payments from my checking account. I also brought up suspected fraud on my accounts but Citibank did not look into the fraud at any point in time. 
I realized that I was in substantial debt because of CP XX/XX/XXXX after I went to withdraw money and my checking balance was much lower than expected because of automatic payments to the maxed out CP account. I again brought up this issue with Citibank representatives : even after speaking to representatives in Spanish, I received written replies in English, which I could not understand. I am now in collections on this account, and continue to receive notices in English. 
Citibank failed to explain this product to me or address my concerns, and has made it impossible for me to effectively bank by communicating with me in English.

Barclay 's app and website indicate "" ENROLLED IN REPEAT PAYMENTS ''. The problem is, Barclay doesn't let you know the first automatic payment does not work. This lead to me incurring a late fee on XX/XX/XXXX. Upon notification of the late fee, I immediately called Barclay to make a payment and ask for the late fee to be removed and reimbursed so this would not impact my credit. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an interest charge fee associated with the previous late payment - which I was told I would not incur. The customer service rep was happy to reverse this charge and today I receive reimbursement for the full amount. 


Barclay 's handling of automatic payments is predatory and misleading. While customer service was quickly able to reverse the fees, I should not have to spend hours of my time on hold and speaking to them about these charges which should not occur.",Credit card or prepaid card

"EXPERIAN REPORTING THE ERROR XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Please REMOVE the reported non-compliant claim from the data furnisher of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for account # XXXX, it currently is deficient of compliant reporting, ILLEGALLY MIND YOU! The accuser is reporting illegally, and the item of report MUST be removed due to failure to have legal standing in full accordance of federal reporting regulations. For one, Account # XXXX  lacks the minimal federally FCRA REQUIRED redacted truncation for lawful reporting. MATHEMATICALLY each MISSING redacted or OVER REDATED value increases likelihood of a fraudulent reporting by ten-fold ( since each character can potentially represent 0-9 each ), so missing the four requisite truncated characters calculates to 10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10x10= 110,000 times GREATER ODDS of potential fraud due to possible identity theft or elsewise. TRUNCATION requirements are to ensure account privacy and consumer protection, any deficiency is OBVIOUS grounds for permanent removal and any injuries resultant of the misreporting is equally suitable grounds for civil action and monetary awards.

In XX/XX/XXXX I experienced the devastating loss of my education due to XXXX XXXX school closure. Since that date, I have fought with the Department of Education, XXXX XXXX and Navient to relinquish the student loans. In XX/XX/XXXX I wrote the State, Local Government and the White House to enlist assistance in requesting the compliance of the Department of Education, and Navient.

"In addition to my TEACH Grants being wrongfully converted to loans in XXXX of XXXX, my loans have now been turned over to the US Department of Education for default. I am NOT in default. According to the most recent escalated rep that I spoke with on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, my loans were put in default on XX/XX/XXXX as a result of an error on their behalf. As XXXX, an escalated rep in the XXXX XXXX explained, the method by which they refunded money to me for payments made to grants, threw my loans into default. As she explained on XX/XX/XXXX, this is "" A big mess '', and it is by no fault of yours. '' I understand that the loans now must go to the "" XXXX XXXX '' and there is no timeline for the "" mess '' to be corrected. Meanwhile, my credit is trashed, and there is no estimated timeline that can be provided to me for the correction to occur. 
The numerous reps that I have spoken with since XXXX regarding my grants, Income-driven payment request, and public loan forgiveness program, have all given me contradictory information, and I have no faith in anyone I speak with there regarding my status on any of the above listed processes. For example, in XXXX, I had an escalated rep guide me through the Income-driven repayment application, wait on the phone until I completed the application, and uploaded to my online account. The next time I spoke with them regarding my expected refund for grant payments, I was told that the refund would not be issued, and that the payments would be credited to the overall loan amount. Yet, I was told in XXXX that I would be receiving a check by XX/XX/XXXX. During that same conversation, I took the opportunity to explain how I was exhausted from having to make numerous calls that usually exceeded 40 minutes, only to have to start over explaining the issues and repeating what I had been told on the previous conversation. Consistently, I was told that I was given incorrect information by previous rep. If it were not the truth, and if it did not cause stress, it would be comical - like a XXXX XXXX XXXX skit. Every rep provided different information regarding the same topic, even among escalated reps ( that I demanded to deal with every call since XXXX ). I complained about how it took 45 minutes and an escalated rep to teach me how to complete my IDR request so that I was not overcharged, and how upset I was that I had paid excessive payments for years because the application did not allow for me to correctly document my financial situation. In other words, I told the rep that the application "" baits '' you in to documenting income and spouse information that is not correct, but you are scared not to document it like that because of the liability you are subject to for filing false information. I told him how thankful I was that 5 years in to filing IDRs and making payments, someone was competent enough, and cared enough, to guide me through the application to get payment lowered where it should be. When I described that situation, the representative said that my IDR request provided "" false '' information, and that it could get me in trouble! I explained again that an escalated rep walked me through it, and waited on the phone for me to upload it and it be received. He said he can see where that happened, but unfortunately the rep gave me incorrect information. He said I could keep the payment where it is for now, but that I would have to file it differently if my husband and I file taxes jointly. 
There are many more occasions in which I have been provided false information and guidance, including information regarding the XXXX program.

o I proceeded to walk down to Bank of America who the check belonged to with the intent to cash the check out since they issued the check originally like I have done with other paychecks from XXXX. I did think it was strange that the account that I got paid out of was a BOA account rather than my previous XXXX checks that I could go cash out no issue. 
o The bank teller refused to cash out my check and stated it was against their policy to cash any check out that is written over {$2000.00} and that I would have to open up an account with them or find someone with an account to deposit it into. 
o Being confused on why they will not cash my paycheck out from a reputable company let alone they wrote the check and still refused to cash my check out against their account they have for XXXX. I politely leave to go to XXXX since I know they can deposit checks into my green dot account for me. 
o After waiting in line, I get to the check cashing teller and thought everything would go smooth, but it did no o XXXX was unable to read the bottom of the check in their check reader due to how Bank of America writing the information at the bottom of the check correctly. By that I mean checks are written ( routing number ) ( bank account number ) ( check number ) that is the format that all MICR check readers are programed to read. Instead Bank of America had set me up to fail anywhere I was to go to deposit the check by writing the banking account information at the bottom ( check number ) ( routing number ) ( bank account number ) so immediately XXXX check reader said failure can not read check information in relation to the bank account information and how it was formatted incorrectly. Now frustrated with this whole event and failing to deposit the check because of Bank of America I leave XXXX. 
o I proceed to cash the check using my bank account with XXXX bank and mobile uploading the check which later caused my account to get shut down due to the formatting of the check itself and them being unable to read the check or them thinking its fraudulent because a lot of checks that are printed like this are fraudulent so they shut my entire account down. Thanks bank of America. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX o Take my check to my friends down the street since they have a Bank of America account and me thinking that if I have them deposit it that it will be received much faster versus going through a different bank, might as well go with the originator of the check. 
o Deposited the check at the local Bank of America atm and it successfully deposits so we think it also allowed me XXXX out of my check so on the deposit slip it says that the funds of {$4400.00} will post on XX/XX/XXXX. 
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX o Receive an update about the check being put on hold till XX/XX/XXXX which is ridiculous since this is their own check and account, so I calmly wait it out.

o Now this makes no sense and they are saying that it had been deposited into the account and released back on the XXXX and when I have payroll look at the history of the check thats what bank of America reported is that the funds have already been released when they have not been and instead they have been sitting on hold unable to be released. 
XX/XX/XXXX o I have tried to talk to the bank to resolve this I have tried to talk to my friend to resolve this but basically the bank has seized my original check for no reason or they are lying to me. Either way since they reported that the funds were released when they obviously have not been and have been sitting on hold into a frozen account which may be closed now due to them flagging my paycheck. 
o They have violated various banking polices and their own banking polices while doing this during a time of emergency out country is currently in, I would believe is illegal to do.

"I have made my student loan payments on time for the full amount since I got out of school. I have several different student loans based on the years in school and I have XXXX loans being serviced by AES ( American Education Services ). The loan issue that I am complaining about is being serviced by AES. On XXXX/XXXX/15 I went on their website and submitted an ACH payment change request. The notice that was on the change request says the following "" Your existing Direct Debit agreement will be stopped. By submitting a new agreement, we will not debit your monthly installment until the new agreement takes effect. Processing the new agreement may take up to 3 days during which time you will not receive the interest rate reduction ( if applicable ). you may be required to submit payments manually until you receive notification from us stating when the direct debit service will resume. '' After reading that statement I set up a manual payment to ensure my payment would not be late. The ACH payment change request I submitted was for an increase of {$490.00}. Despite the fact that the notice said my existing direct debit agreement will be stopped AES took out my normal direct debit amount and the manual payment ( in essence 2 payments instead of 1 ). After a month I received no written or verbal communication from AES so I called their toll free number and inquired as to why it was taking to long to make a simple payment change and I was informed that "" it had to go to a payment change committee to decide if they will allow me to have my payment increased. '' I was baffled that they would possibly not allow me to pay additional money so that my loan can be paid off sooner. They told me to wait longer and I would receive a letter within a couple weeks. After another month ( now 2 months after the initial request was submitted ) I still had not received any communication from AES so I called their toll free number again and spoke to employee ID XXXX who besides being quite rude said they could n't determine what the problem is with my request. He guessed that I should submit a manual form and mail it in. After I explained I already submitted a form 2 months ago online he said that I should just mail a form in ( despite not providing a form ) and said that the website was broken.

"On XX/XX/XXXX our legally XXXX mother was allowed to sign a reverse mortgage document without her POA present or acknowledgments. Prior to the closing extensive approval had to be completed to approve the POA because my mother was legally XXXX. Her apparent XXXX is evident in the documents signed and attached in the exhibits. 
The mortgage company required : ( EX1 ) 1. A personal letter from our mother to the mortgage and title companies stating she was XXXX and could not read or write and her daughter would be signing the documents as a POA. 
( EX2 ) 2. A letter from her doctor stating she was legally XXXX and could not read or write. 
( EX3 ) 3. A durable POA document completed so her daughter could sign as the POA for the  Reverse Mortgage of her XXXX mother. 
( EX8 ) 4. Numerous other documents title searches and other preparations to have a POA approved to read and sign for the Reverse Mortgage were completed. 

XX/XX/XXXX, just prior to scheduling a closing date, a ( EX4 ) Title Commitment Schedule B-1 revised was issued with Mom and the POA both on the document. 
The Title Commitment was given ready to close for a reverse mortgage along with other requirements, On XX/XX/XXXX. On that day we needed to have some things done as part of the commitment requirements and one of them was the ( EX5 ) transfer the deed from daughter and mother to just the mothers name. That was completed. ( EX6 ) Upon completion of the deed, we proceeded to the mortgage documents -- however, the documents did not have the POA so they would have to be redone. The closing was stopped by Mom and the POA. The POA was not allowed to sign those incorrectly prepared documents. The closing was supposed to be rescheduled so the correct documents could be made and signed with the borrower and POA present together.

We left that day of closing and somewhere in the interim of us leaving the closing table and the end of the evening the closing agent continued to have the documents signed b
y our XXXX and terminally ill mother. No reason was given other than it was acceptable. This all happened at my mothers home. 
The facts are this : ( EX9 ) Our XXXX mother was given a POA and approved to sign a reverse mortgage by mortgage and title.. 
( EX10 ) All title commitments and mortgage commitments were approved by the title and mortgage companies to move forward with the signing of the documents with our XXXX mother and her POA.. 
( EX7 ) A Cover Protection Letter CPL was issued with Mom and POA prior to closing. 

The closing was stopped all parties because the mortgage package documents were wrongly prepared by the mortgage. 
Despite this, a title clerk and mortgage company moved forward and allowed mortgage documents to be signed by a legally XXXX elderly woman. ( EX11 ) After the documents were signed the title and the mortgage eagerly covered up the process by leaving off all the required items on a checklist to make the commitment valid for signing. They took the POA off all the documents and issued a mortgage in only the XXXX elderly 's name taking away her rights of the POA on the mortgage and title insurance and providing no reasons, verifications, or justifications for those actions.

Other facts to consider : Our mom originally was given 2 options a line of credit or a full amount lump sum. It was originally asked, by mom, for {$20000.00} and to leave the rest in equity in an open line of credit.However, it was strongly encouraged by the mortgage company that she should take the full lump sum since the interest rates were lower. 
( EX14 ) HUD 1 The loan amount was for {$78000.00}. She received {$70000.00}, with {$7700.00} taken out as excessive fees. This is nearly 10 % of the loan in just costs and fees. We consider these costs fee-overreaching. 
( EX12 ) They appraised the home at {$110000.00}, yet the home value at that time was only {$50000.00} to {$60000.00}, and it still is only worth that today. In fact the Mortgage Company ( EX13 ) performed another appraisal on the premises by another independent appraiser in XX/XX/XXXX which valued the property at XXXX using an exterior value only. We think appraisal fraud could also be considered All of the equity was taken from the home on that day. 
Fraud and collusion between the title company and bank were possibly done if they pushed through a loan amount for the commissions and fees just to close the loan. 
We demand a full investigation by the NJ DOBI, Attorney Generals office, and CFPB of the actions of the bank and processes that enabled and allowed this loan to close with such heinous actions. This is not a case of misspelled names or who owns the note -- this is a serious matter of insurance mortgage and collusion to prey upon and commit fraud on an elderly, and XXXX woman.",Mortgage

JUST TO EMPHASIZE HERE, CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO ACCESS THEIR OWN MONEY FOR 3 WEEKS WITH NO EXPLANATION WHATSOEVER FROM AMEX, XXXX, SERVE, OR ANYONE ELSE. THIS IS AMERICA. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND CRIMINAL. 

These are prepaid debit cards onto which consumers can have funds directly deposited. For example, I had my employer deposit a small portion of each paycheck to my card, which I used for gas. But some people may have their whole paycheck deposited to it, or their unemployment, stimulus money, or tax refund. NONE of which is now accessible. American Express claims they have nothing to do with the debit cards that are emblazoned with THEIR name and logo.

"I disputed a charge of {$250.00} which was charged on XX/XX/XXXX from a vendor ( XXXX ) that did not perform and present a website accordingly and in a TIMELY MANNER. After not receiving a well put together website with a few days as promised, I requested cancellation of the entire service. They said I didn't but I did via phone conversation and email request. I told them not to proceed I was not happy with the "" ugly '' website. It was terrible and I had to keep asking "" why isn't the site up and running. '' ( See attached ) I provided proof, email conversations, and dates of the transaction and conversations to Capital One who decided to deny my dispute because I did not provide A SECOND OPINION from another company who knew nothing about this transaction. Not only did they deny the dispute but they took their own good time responding ; two representatives call on two separate occasions and neither one followed through with the dispute without saying they don't see my documents. I was asked on three different occasions to send my proof, when I had already done so as requested by their deadline. They said they didn't see it when I had confirmation of the email. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX wrote to Capital One that they see the "" charge back of the funds, as FRAUD. This of course was a lie. They just didn't want to give me back my money after not performing. I have never in my life had a company ask for a "" second opinion '' from another business who is not involved with a dispute. I had no clue who to involved in this. I felt this to be very UNFAIR to me as a card holder who paid my account on time and who cherished that fact that I was granted the account. I am very insulted and feel as though I'm being discriminated against regarding this matter. Capital One refused to value my opinion as though I was lying about everything. I told Capital One on multiple occasions that I WILL NOT BE PAYING FOR THAT CHARGE and now they have added 2 late fees taking the balance up to {$340.00} and they have reported me as being two months late which has cause a decrease in my improving credit score. I had my scores close to XXXX, I have been working diligently to improve my credit and clean up my credit and now this. I have warned them that I will continue to dispute this and I refuse to be a victim of such a request of asking a "" second opinion '' for proof that a vendor did not perform. Yes I was paying for and agreeing to service that I did not receive according to their time frame.

"**The previous page did not allow me to actually select an option that fit my situation, I apologize** Capital One promised by email to return my account to 'good standing ' if I paid {$610.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I took half of my stimulus check and paid the amount before XX/XX/XXXX but my account is restricted and remains so. I spoke with an account specialist approximately a month ago and promised to pay an additional {$33.00} ( in addition to the {$50.00} auto pay amount ) on my next payment date of XX/XX/XXXX. I missed making the payment by one day and when accessing the website on XX/XX/XXXX noticed that a different amount was due ( {$25.00} ). I paid the {$25.00} but saw that the account was still permanently restricted and would not be unrestricted. 

I am just now able to review their previous response to my complaint ; I could not access the website to review and was unable to retrieve my mail from the PO Box to which it was sent due to COVID-19 ; however, my concern is this : **If my account were going to GO on restriction, why was that information not put in one of the emails that I received between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that indicated that my account was in danger of being charged off? Instead. I was told that my account would remain current and in good standing if I paid before XX/XX/XXXX. So, in XXXX, when I received the stimulus check ( the only way that I could make a large enough payment to satisfy Capital One ), I paid the requested {$610.00} to bring my account current. Because the emails stated that would happen, I expected it to be so. However, upon going online in late XXXX/early XXXX to verify receipt of the balloon payment ( I received no confirmation of payment from Capital One ), I noticed that my account was 'restricted '. The account specialist that I spoke with put in a request to have the restriction lifted but upon checking today, XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered that the restriction WILL NOT be lifted. It is disappointing and frustrating, I feel that Capital One misrepresented the facts and did not uphold what was stated in the email. I have struggled to pay something every month since I have had the account ; Capital One seems to want to push me to pay more than I can afford -- we agree to disagree on that point : I have multiple bills to pay and EVERYONE has to be paid, not just Capital One. I do not believe that they acted in 'good faith ', I do not believe that they have been honest -- I paid {$610.00} to them expecting for them to restore my account standing ; I could have used that amount to pay on several other essential bills. At this point, nothing will satisfy Capital One and they are unwilling to compromise ( a compromise to them is that I pay what they want despite my inability to pay that amount : I on the other hand, have made compromises : I have increased my original auto pay from {$35.00} to {$50.00}, I have paid larger amounts including the {$610.00} balloon, and I agreed to pay a one-time amount of {$83.00} ( which turned out to be {$75.00} ). I can not /could not pay more but am paying every month. Again, I am disappointed, frustrated and feel hopeless that this was not resolved to mutual satisfaction. I am further dismayed since it seems that Capital One said made a false claim to get me to make that large balloon payment of {$610.00} and then, reneged on the statement to restore my account to 'good standing ' once that large payment was received. I feel that I was lied to, I was lied to and it does not feel good, at all.",Debt collection

XXXX XXXX determined not to help even though my father, in his XXXX, was XXXX. The trust remained with XXXX XXXX main client, WF. After my father 's death, none of the assets of the trust were administered correctly. WF concealed the disposition of some of the assets until we were forced to go to court to see what happened to them. Despite evidence proving complete mismanagement by WF, XXXX XXXX of the XXXX, MN ruled in favor of WF and levied {$35000.00} in court costs against the beneficiaries for questioning where the assets went. WF had an obligation to inform the beneficiaries of the asset distribution. WF has consumed most of the assets of the trust through negligence and inappropriate charges. Beneficiaries have received {$.00} on the dollar, 5 years after my father 's death, with little chance of seeing more. {$800000.00} of my parents ' XXXX XXXX have either been consumed or will likely remain unavailable. XXXX XXXX has grossly overcharged the trust by repeatedly "" reviewing the file '', with no benefit to the beneficiaries as specified in trust law. The property manager, XXXX XXXX, repeatedly blamed the beneficiaries for Wells Fargo 's failure to sell the home despite Wells Fargo owning the assets of the trust. We are on our XXXX trustee. XXXX XXXX was appointed by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX has spent the money in the trust, destroyed the garage and shop by refusing to remove excessive snow, causing a roof collapse, and completely neglecting the property by not maintaining or even mowing the lawn. He has provided no documentation of expenses. He collected an insurance payment for the damage that I discovered in XXXX XXXX. Neither XXXX XXXX nor the realtor had checked on the property since the roof collapse in XXXX of XXXX. To date XXXX XXXX has not had the destroyed garage removed from the property.

He has violated every fiduciary responsibility of a trustee. I wrote to XXXX XXXX XXXX begging to get rid of XXXX XXXX and asking that I be made trustee. My father 's will designated me as personal representative in the absence of WF, but XXXX XXXX ignored that. In response XXXX XXXX said that the communication was ex parte and demanded that I file motions with the court. Why would I expect a different response than the completely inadequate XXXX that we got before? We are stuck with a trustee who has broken the law in destroying our property, and with a judge who is in charge. We have been prohibited by XXXX XXXX via court order from contacting XXXX XXXX who is in charge of the destruction.

XXXX XXXX could scarcely have been any more incompetent at selling the home, his main purpose as trustee. 
When I have explored other websites to report WF 's mishandling of the trust I was discouraged by the requirement that the issue had not been addressed in court. Clearly, WF is familiar with using courts to their advantage.

He called to tell me that this was his final call and that due to the lack of contact on my end, they were forced to write me off as a direct refusal for voluntary cooperation. This was after I called and spoke with him that same morning and attempted to get further information on this claim in writing and tried to discuss options to get this cleared. This was after Mr. XXXX hung up on me as I pleaded with him for a workable solution. To say that I refused voluntary cooperation is a completely deceptive and blatant lie.

"Our home was condemned after XXXX # XXXX. Wells Fargo stated they were estimating we had a 25 % property loss immediately following but then cancelled the property loss inspection upon notice of the condemnation and have refused to come do an inspection on the home which engineers and contractors estimated the repairs necessary would exceed the 50 % value mark. So, we hired a lawyer to try to get the property loss department to come inspect the home and forwarded all mold tests, contractor letters, estimates, safety inspections, etc that we had collected and paid for immediately following the disaster. Not having or being required to carry flood insurance left us with a very small insurance settlement that would only cover the repairs to the roof sustained from wind and hail damage during the storm. Additionally, code violations, mold hazards, and foundation repairs must occur before any insured roof work could be permitted. They then refused to release the insurance check to us to use to stop mold growth that they were notified of following the disaster and stated they needed time to review and research. More than five months have passed, and the mold is out of control. Now, the entire home has to be gutted and the entire structure will have to be brought to code which exceeds the value of the home 100 %. At first, all We asked is that they defer the amount we were behind due to costs of the repairs necessary to fix the safety related code violations and we asked they endorse the insurance settlement to be used to address the mold and electrical violations. They have refused to do so, and refused to respond in any manner other than to keep notifying our attorney they need two more weeks to complete their research. They have been claiming they need two more weeks for months. Their ameliorative waste has now cost us the entire home and any chance of restoring the home, as well as the cost of the repairs and renovations made just prior to the storm, and 15 years of equity into a 20 year mortgage. Additionally, we are paying each week for a construction dumpster to remain on the property while we "" wait '' for them to complete their research. We have now been paying for months, and are simply losing even more money while they do nothing. 
During the course of this ridiculousness, we were treated poorly, insulted, lied to, discriminated against, and have been being pressured to just give them a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Their property loss department has outright ignored our Attorney 's written requests that they contact him. We are preparing an offensive lawsuit against them for ameliorative waste, all monies / equity lost, and the money we have spent trying to preserve the property while we waited for them to do absolutely nothing. Their "" inaction '' has caused the home recovery during one of the worst events of our life - A XXXX - to become impossible. Because of their inaction, our home is now a total loss. Where we had hope and potential for recovery before, there now is none.

He also stated that he talked with my wife and she said to call me. He stated that I had to be lying about the cars whereabouts because she told him to reach out to me. I am the one in charge of finances, which is why the debt collectors were referred to me because I am the one who knows when we would be able to make the payments and for how much. But he continued to insist that I was lying to him and continued to threaten legal action against me for refusing to surrender the car. I then requested a supervisor. The supervisor was very polite and understanding of the situation I was in.

He stated that the attempts to repossess the vehicle would continue until the payment was made and that they looked forward to receiving the payment the following week and wished me the best of luck.

Unfortunately my friend no longer has access to that original account.

"For the record before I begin the actual complaint I want to make it known that this is XXXX XXXX the actual human being and living soul that is making this complaint. The previous complaint I filed against EQUIFAX on XX/XX/XXXX CASE- XXXX, EQUIFAX falsely assumed for no valid reason and chose not to respond by claiming that the complaint may have been filed by a credit repair company, which was completely false. Again this is XXXX XXXX filing this complaint and no other entity or parties are involved. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent a notarized letter to EQUIFAX disputing several items ; it was received by EQUIFAX onXX/XX/XXXX. In this correspondence I also attached a police report for several education loans that are being falsely reported on my credit file. I was very specific in my correspondence that this police report was for those specific items which would include XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ; the police report was n't for every item I disputed in my correspondence. The police report was only for these specific items ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as stated in my correspondence datedXX/XX/XXXX. I received a correspondence from EQUIFAX dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that EQUIFAX, at this time, will not block the information subject to the submitted identity theft and/or police report. EQUIFAX provided no reason nor did EQUIFAX cite a law for this action. According to FCRA 605B ( 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2 ), a consumer reporting agency shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date of receipt by such agency of ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report ; ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer ; and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. EQUIFAX has decided to disregard this section of the FCRA. Also, in regards to the items I have disputed that were not included in the police report that need to be properly and lawfully verified, which I have requested from EQUIFAX several times, with no compliance on the part of EQUIFAX. I have requested their method of verification and EQUIFAX has not complied and has admitted through their actions and agents that the verification process is automated and electronic codes are sent between the credit bureau and alleged creditors and/or data furnishers, which are not properly or lawfully verifying any accounts/items. The definition of verify in a XXXX 's Law Dictionary is stated and defined as the following : "" To confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit ; to show to be true. Particularly used of making formal oath to accounts, petitions, pleadings, and other papers. The word "" verified '' when used in statute, ordinarily imports a verity attested by the sanctity of an oath. It is used interchangeably with sworn. To prove to be true ; to confirm or establish the truth or truthfulness of ; to check or test the accuracy or exactness of ; to confirm or establish the authenticity of ; to authenticate ; to maintain ; to affirm ; to support ; second ; back as a friend. XXXX v. XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ''. EQUIFAX is admittedly not verifying items/accounts according to this definition from the XXXX law dictionary. For an item to be properly, legally and lawfully verified ; the alleged creditor/data furnisher must "" confirm or substantiate by oath or affidavit '' that means that a living human being and authorized representative of the alleged creditor and/or data furnisher must attest under oath that a debt is actually owed and that the information they are reporting to the credit bureau is completely true and completely correct. This does not occur by sending electronic codes between the credit bureau and alleged creditor and/or data furnisher. EQUIFAX continues to disregard the law and defame my name by falsely reporting items/accounts that I have provided a police report for and they also continue to falsely report several items/accounts that they have not properly and lawfully verified according to the legal definition of Verify defined in a Blacks Law dictionary.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

Because my payments were being made late every month ( instead of being made on the XXXX to cover the payment due on the next XXXX, as I assumed ), they had been taking part of the money supposed to go toward one of my Perkins loans and instead applying it to the late fees, causing my loan to show that it was delinquent for two months.

This explanation, quite simply, is ridiculous. Automatic payments are meant to be set so that the payor does not have to log in to his account every month and make sure the correct amount is being paid.

"Dear Sir or Madam, 1. CAPITAL ONE Account Number:XXXX**** Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XXXX and XX/XX/2020. 

I immediately disputed this information with CAPITAL ONE and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, and XXXX. ) as stated below : XXXX. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency.

Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

"I entered a payment arrangement with this company after they harassed me and called me at all hours of the day, and subsequently threatened legal action and then started legal action. They would not initially identify themselves when they first started calling me so I never responded. When I was notified of legal action, I reached out to Midland Credit Management , Inc. - XXXX   and was notified of the debt. They told me I had to pay the full amount {$2700.00}, which I could not and then they said I could try and enter a payment arrangement if I paid {$190.00} at the time of the call and then subsequently {$100.00} a month until the debt was paid in full. I agreed to pay the {$190.00} and then {$100.00} a month following that on the XXXX of every month. They stated that legal action would stop so long as I made my payments on time and that if I defaulted on payments legal action would continue and a judgment would be entered against me which could result in me losing my job possibly, according to them. I said okay, and paid. I paid {$190.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and then {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$100.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I checked my credit score at the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX and it showed they were still reporting the balance owed of {$2700.00}, and were reporting that I had not made any payments. It stated on my XXXX  credit report that the last time they had updated information was in XXXX of XXXX. I called Midland Credit Management , Inc. - XXXX in XXXX and asked if they could update the debt to reflect the accurate balance and that I had indeed made three payments at this point. They gave me the run around and transferred me and gave me different phone numbers to call and after 2 hours, I was told no one was trained on "" Credit Reporting '' and that they would not update the correct balance or payments until the balance was paid in full. They could not give me any assurance of when that would be reported or if it would officially be reported to Credit Bureaus or just reported in Midland Credit Management , Inc. - XXXX systems. I was told not to dispute, just to be patient and keep paying as I had agreed or legal action would resume. I was told that they could see in their records that they were aware they were reporting the incorrect balance and inaccurate payment details and they showed the last time they had updated or reported anything about the debt was 5 months prior in XXXX. I then contacted XXXX  and disputed this debt as they were reporting inaccurate balance amount and inaccurate payment history of the debt. I was notified on XX/XX/XXXX that the dispute was successful and that the debt was being deleted from my Credit Report and my Credit Score went up. I called Midland Credit Management , Inc. - XXXX  and informed them of the dispute and that the debt was deleted from my Credit Score and I asked if I was still legally required to pay the debt. They would not answer me and laughed at me twice. They asked me if I only pay my debts when I'm forced legally or if I pay out of moral responsibility. I asked multiple times, "" Am I legally required to keep paying now that the debt was disputed and removed from my Credit Report '' and they would not answer. The first agent I spoke with offered right away after her system showed that the debt was disputed, to cancel my payment plan, and I asked again, am I still required to pay, or not, since the debt was deleted and disputed, she would not answer. I was transferred to two different supervisors and after 1.5 hours, I was told if I didn't continue to pay, they would restart the lawsuit, possibly garnish my bank account and that I would have a judgement entered against me, but would not answer if I was legally required to keep paying on a deleted debt. They would not answer and kept repeating the question to me "" do you only pay bills when you are legally forced ''?. They would not answer me and after so long, and speaking with two supervisors, who would not give me their real name, I gave up.

"I began the statement period on XX/XX/20 with a statement balance of XXXX. On XX/XX/20, I made a purchase on XXXX for {$580.00}. I was prompted with an offer to use a Citi card to qualify the purchase for 0 % APR for 24 months via a Citi Flex Plan. On XX/XX/20, I made a payment of {$300.00} to cover the previous statement balance. According to my statement ending XX/XX/20 ( due XX/XX/20 ), my flex plan balance had gone from XXXX to XXXX. With a total balance {$1000.00} categorized as standard purchases. I had made a series of returns for transactions as standard purchases throughout the XXXX period. It appears that the credit for some of these standard purchase returns were used to offset my XXXX interest balance, while new purchase continued to add to my standard purchase balance. However, multiple representatives could not confirm the cause of the reduced balance. 

On XX/XX/20, I called customer service and spoke with an account specialist who assured me the full balance of XXXX would be reinstated as a flex plan balance, and that this would occur in 3-5 business days. On XX/XX/20 ( the 5th business day ), I reached out to customer service via chat to check on the status of the balance transfer, as my payment due date was the following day and failure to transfer the balance would subject it to interest rate charges. The representative told me to check at XXXX and I would see the balance transfer. On XX/XX/20 ( my payment due date ), I received a letter dated XX/XX/20 that my balance transfer could not be reinstated without any further explanation. I subsequently called customer service again, who was unable to offer any assistance or explanation. The only solution offered was to put in a request for reinstatement, without any guarantee that it would be successful, or solution to my concern that an open balance would result in an interest charge. As a result, I had to pay off the remaining balance so as to avoid interest rate charges on this balance. 

Further, when I asked to file a complaint, the representative initially claimed that she was unable to do so. It appears she was unaware of how to complete this or who to contact, as she asked me who I would like to be transferred to. After a final request to talk to anyone who could put me in touch with compliance, she offered to transfer me to a US representative who was finally able to file a complaint. 

Without any helpful context from customer service, it appears the application of return credits can be used to offset XXXX interest balances, despite standard purchases being made in the same period. This is deceptive and manipulative, as it allows return credits to be used to offset XXXX interest balances, while standard purchase balances with high interest rates are allowed to accrue. Further, it makes it difficult for consumers as they must always pay attention to their current balance, minus their XXXX interest balance, when making returns, or risk their return credit being applied to the XXXX interest balance when standard purchase transactions will be made soon thereafter.",Credit card or prepaid card

"i asked, via requests for admissions, are plaintiff 's attorneys and the law firm debt collectors per arkansas code annotated 17-24-502 [ 5 ] [ a ] and 15 u.s. code 1692a [ 6 ]. the response was no. 


at the motion hearing, plaintiff 's attorney stated the law firm, nor the attorneys are parties to the law suit, only filed the law suit on behalf of plaintiff. i said, sure, but you still are liable under the codes per the latest u.s. supreme court decisions : XXXX, XXXX ; XXXX ; and other similar cases declaring, 'any person who regularly engages in debt collection activity, including litigation, ' is a debt collector per the arkansas and federal codes. 


nonetheless, the judge dismissed my counter-claims, saying he is not stating the supreme court justices were wrong in their decisions, but stated he does not believe the attorneys are debt collectors, simply because they filed a complaint for an alleged breach of contract. 


because the complaint had the statement 'this communication is from a debt collector, ' this gave me the impression the action was real. however, upon asking the question of affirmation to being a debt collector, the answer was no. what was i to believe at this point, the claim was not valid and could not be brought or maintained due to this discovery of the status of the attorneys who filed the claim against me? 


he also struck the documents i provided proving they are debt collectors, which came from their web site : hoodandstacy.com because the attorney said they were not authenticated, even though they have been doing the same for more than 20 years. each document i filed has a notarized certificate of service, this is authentication ; otherwise, what good is the lawyer 's signature on the certificate of service, other than authenticating the documents served. further, if the documents were not authenticated, this means the information on the web site is not authentic, a further reason to state a breach of the fair debt collection practices act for false and misleading information. 


the judge told me i could take up his dismissals on appeal. 


per arkansas code 17-24-507 and 15 u.s. code 1692f - unfair practices by filing the form with the above language, then stating they are not debt collectors, this is an unfair and an unconscionable means to collect or attempt to collect any alleged debt, which i told the judge, but he ignored me. 


per arkansas code 17-24-506 et seq and 15 u.s. code 1692e et seq by filing the complaint with the statement 'this communication is from a debt collector, ' then denying being debt collectors, this is using a false, deceptive and misleading means in connection with the collection of an alleged debt. also, falsely represents the legal status of an alleged debt, taking action, because they claim to not be debt collectors, which can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken. further, delivering the complaint with the mentioned phrase, creates a false impression as to its source, authorization, or approval. also, by filing the complaint with the said phrase, denying being debt collectors, this is a deceptive means to collect and to obtain information concerning me. 


per arkansas code 17-24-511 and 15 u.s. code 1692j by filing the complaint with the statement 'this communication is from a debt collector, ' then denying being debt collectors, this is furnishing a form knowing the form will be used to create the false belief that a person other than the alleged creditor is participating in the collection of or in an attempt to collect an alleged debt, when the person is not participating in collecting or attempting to collect the alleged debt.",Debt collection

We're filing this complaint, today, because there are a number of very serious issues with the loan modification that was done for us by Nationstar Mortgage - now Mr. Cooper. 

Before getting into the history of my account with mr. Cooper, I'd like to outline a number of issues that are extremely troubling and a basis for legal action - - in XXXX we were sent paperwork on hamp letterhead, outlining a Tier-2 hamp modification - neither XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX can find this modification OR our modified loan - neither XXXX XXXX or XXXX XXXX are listed on any legal motions that we received from mr. Cooper - the entity listed as the investor on the motions is XXXX XXXX XXXX - we never received a mr. Cooper signed copy of the alleged hamp modification It is clear that mr. Cooper has acted with malice and fraudulence regarding - the misrepresentation of the modification itself, the fact that they've ensured this loan to it's full value ( insurance fraud ), that mr. Cooper has committed countless respa and federal compliance violations. Most egregiously - the XXXX modification play XXXX loan at almost 150 % loan-to-value. Neither HUD NOR Federal lending guidelines would ever allow that we are submitting this last complaint to you, in the hopes that these matters will escalate this to a pointed that brings mr. Cooper to the table to resolve things. If we can not accomplish this task, we've already identified legal counsel and will retain them and begin filingmotions, with the hope that they will be shortly followed by indictments We purchased our home in XXXX and refinanced in XXXX. At the time when we refinanced, we paid {$150000.00}. We were doing fine, until XXXX when a series of unfortunate happenings occurred. Nationstar was happy to assist us and the attached paperwork is the result of their work. 



As you can see, in the modification documents, the POST modification Principal Balance amount is {$190000.00}. they took all of our past due payments, the interest, late fees and legal fees and simply added them to the principal balance. This put us at roughly 150 % loan to value. Which, is against Federal and HAMP guidelines. 



I'd like to ask you to look further at the documents and you'll see that this is 'titled ' as a HAMP Modification. However, when I spoke with a representative at Mr. Cooper, on the XXXX, we were informed that our modification was, indeed an in-house Tier 2 modification. These are some very alarming and disturbing issues. 



The current value of our home is roughly {$120000.00} and Mr. Cooper is refusing to assist us, as my fiance has been on standby from his construction work since last XXXX. He's about to go back to work next week and we have more than enough disposable income to resolve this issue and get back to the good faith payments. 



We're asking that you assist us with resolving this matter amicably and to the best of our interest. What we're looking for is a proper loan modification - with the past due payments recapitalized into the remaining 37 years of the note, as well as, a Current Market Value appraisal of our home, so we will be paying a fair market  value. 



You can reach out to me at XXXX or my fianc at XXXX who is on the note I'm on title, any time. Thank you and we appreciate your assistance with this matter!",Mortgage

"XXXX  XXXX Credit Card account was reporting activity on a charged-off account, also showing balance as available credit. Disputed this account and it was removed XXXX, XXXX. Portfolio Recovery and Associates first appeared on my XXXX  credit report XX/XX/XXXX, and listed an open date of XX/XX/XXXX. The account posted a second time, on XX/XX/XXXX, and reported an open date of XX/XX/XXXX. As dispute report results arrived, credit reports from all three credit were generated as well. By XX/XX/XXXX, the Portfolio account had been filed in all three credit reports, showing different dates between each of the credit reports, and conflicting with what had been reported to XXXX  just months earlier, where this account first appeared. Every report, and the results of every investigation is always kept by me. This has given me a very clear picture of what Portfolio has done. By XX/XX/XXXX, Portfolio 's information had changed drastically and multiple times ; the first month this account had appeared, XX/XX/XXXX, was now referred to as the "" date of status '', XX/XX/XXXX became the "" first reported '', changing from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX, finally becoming simply, XX/XX/XXXX. The new date, XX/XX/XXXX is now the "" date opened '', and would later become XX/XX/XXXX. I have on my credit file a hard inquiry from XXXX XXXX, dated just 6 days prior, that I did not initiate and did not become evident to me until Portfolio began reporting the XXXX date as the date the account opened. XXXX XXXX appears in the soft pull list several times, giving the reason for the entry each time. The hard inquiry, however, is supposed to list a valid reason, such as applying for a loan or credit card, but states nothing. This account is the charged-off debt I had first mentioned here, that had been disputed and was removed from my credit report a short time before. The hard inquiry states that XXXX XXXX initiated the hard inquiry, which I do not believe they would do for their own records. This account had recently been removed ; once removed, it can not reappear on a person 's credit file. The account was re-inserted, or parked, as their had not been any communication from Portfolio. The account then did not appear on file until months later, posting twice to cause more damage to my credit report and intentional to motivate the hopeful need for a fast payoff. As shown clearly by the numerous date changes, not appearing for months on XXXX  and XXXX XXXX reports, before quietly landing just after the hard inquiry, as if this hides anything. I have had a very difficult time trying to remove this account, and its outrageous to me these companies are allowed to operate, and that so many people are subjected to this. It is very serious, as these types of accounts cause such damage, keeping families from owning cars or buying homes, it is well known that an astounding 70-80 % of credit reports are not accurate, and yet are allowed to go on harming people everywhere. I just figured out even more as I type this out the lengths Portfolio went to keep this account on my file, and am even more disgusted. Despite how blatantly obvious this is to me, and would be to others, and this being one of the biggest debt buyers, and most involved in lawsuits, I do not understand how these companies are still in business, or the purpose they could possibly serve being allowed to continue. With that, I believe I have more than adequately described why I should no longer have to deal with this account. It has taken far too much of my time already, has deprived me from a variety of opportunities already, and has clearly violated my rights under the FCRA and FDCPA. I would like to ask the CFPB for their assistance in removing this account from my file. I have previously asked Portfolio for debt validation, and had been given the front page of my old XXXX XXXX statement, showing what I had owed at the time, in a much smaller format, and printed on paper bearing Portfolio 's markings. This is obviously insufficient, and supposed to be supplied from the original creditor, not the debt buyer.

The HELOC I opened is at a 4.99 % XXXX so this only made sense to me to save money on interest. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX told me the 2 payoff checks for the credit cards would come in the mail within a week of closing but it took about 3 weeks to finally receive them and according to my Loan Officer, they were experiencing a lot of issues with the mail as of late. This made me feel concerned about mailing out my 2 payoff checks to XXXX XXXX and Capital One in case they were lost in the mail so I decided to just do mobile check deposits, to be safe. My XXXX XXXX mobile check deposit went through fine and the funds were applied to my credit card within a couple of days. When I tried to do a mobile deposit directly to my Capital One credit card, it wouldn't go through. I realized that I most likely needed to have a Savings or a Checking account opened to be able to do mobile deposits so I decided to open a Checking account with Capital One at that point. I transferred {$50.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to the new account as an initial deposit. Once opened, I did the mobile deposit. There was a hold on the check, which was fine and expected due to the fact that it was a new account and the check was in the amount of {$3800.00}. I deposited the funds to Capital One Checking account # XXXX on Sat, XX/XX/XXXX and the hold was to be in place until XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX.

The next day, Capital One reversed the {$3800.00} I had applied to my credit card and put it back into the Capital One Checking account with a hold on it. I called them the next morning on Fri, XXXX, to find out what had happened. The representative I spoke to said that it was most likely due to the fact that the check was made payable to Capital One with my name only in the memo section noted "" S.Guide '' and it wasn't made payable to myself. She said she would just need to call the originating credit union that issued the check, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and confirm the authenticity of the check to release the hold. I was on hold for about 5 - 7 minutes and assumed she was calling XXXX XXXX XXXX. When she came back on the line, she said that Capital One has the made the decision to terminate the banking relationship with me and that I would never be allowed to open an account with them in the future. She didn't explain if she had called XXXX XXXX XXXX or what would happen with the money I had sent in. I was so surprised and asked why but her response was that "" ... for security reasons, I can not release this information to you. '' I asked her what would happen to the money I sent in and she said it would remain on hold for now as they investigated it but she did not have a timeline as to how long this would be. I was flabbergasted as I couldn't imagine what would be the cause for concern but figured I just needed to wait. I called back about twice a week at this point for the next couple of weeks just to check in on the investigation but received no answers or explanations. I left voicemails for the Risk Department where I was being transferred to each time because the representatives said they are handling the investigation and would know more ; however, nobody ever called me back. 

Then I thought that maybe because it's a new account, they wanted to keep the funds on hold for at least 30 days so I stopped calling and waited until the XXXX day after they had cashed the check ( cashed on XX/XX/XXXX ) and called them on Mon, XX/XX/XXXX. I was directed to the "" Risk Department '' of Capital One and spoke to a representative there. I explained to her the situation and told her I could provide all of my identifying documentation to prove my identity and to support my situation, that she could check my credit report to see the HELOC had been opened - whatever they needed to conclude their investigation and release my funds, I would be able to provide. To this, she responded that "" Capital One is NEVER going to release those funds to you. You need to have XXXX XXXX XXXX request the funds back. '' I asked her what would happen if they couldn't and she said "" They will know how to do it. They will be able to override the system to pull the funds back. '' I then asked her about the {$50.00} that I had transferred over from XXXX XXXX when I first opened the account - if that could be sent back. She said "" No, that won't be released until XXXX XXXX XXXX pulls back the funds that are on hold. '' So, I called XXXX XXXX XXXX directly after this and explained this situation to XXXX XXXX there, a financial services representative. She spoke with her supervisor and the accounting supervisor to see if there was anything they could do for me.

"Between XXXX and XXXX of 2019 my loan was transferred from XXXX to LoanCare LLC. Since I have been dealing with loan companies for over 45 years this was nothing new. I began making payments to LoanCare starting with the XX/XX/XXXX payment due date ( check # XXXX written on XXXX and cashed by LoanCare on XX/XX/2019 ). 

I received a notice dated XXXX XXXX that no payment had been received. I immediately wrote to LoanCare through their web site. Finally Ms. XXXX XXXX contacted me through e-mail on XX/XX/2019 asking for copies of checks related to my loan payments. Prior to this e-mail I had sent a letter containing copy of checks, then a packet of check copies ( traceable through USPS since LoanCare has made it quite obvious that they do not seem to know what they are doing ). I sent a second traceable ( via USPS ) packet of checks since this problem was spiraling out of control. In early XXXX I received a statement ( statement date XX/XX/2019 ) indicating that I owed LoanCare {$1800.00}. I have bank copies of check # XXXX written on XX/XX/2019 and cashed on XX/XX/2019, check # XXXX written on XX/XX/2019 and cashed by LoanCare on XX/XX/2019, check # XXXX written on XX/XX/2019 and cashed by LoanCare on XX/XX/2019. Thus indicating all payments were paid in a timely manner. 

In a "" Payment Reminder Notice '' dated XX/XX/2019 I again was notified of payment not being received. I have copies of an e-mail on this same date between Ms. XXXX XXXX of LoanCare and myself. Ms. XXXX was requesting copies of payment checks. I informed Ms. XXXX that this would be the FOURTH time I provided proof of payment to LoanCare. I attached copies of the payment checks to the e-mail. I also advised Ms. XXXX, and attached documatation, that my credit rating had taken a dive of over 100 points due to their inability to rectify the payment issue. I also noted the cost to me so far. It was, {$0.00} for letter with check copy, {$7.00} for a traceable packet sent through USPS, and a second traceable packet sent through USPS for a second charge of {$7.00}. I feel I should not have to pay to rectify their screw-up. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a statement indicating I owe a fee of {$38.00} for having a late charge added to my mortgage payment amount owed. I paid my usual amount NOT including a completely unwarranted late payment fee. Realizing this situation is completely out of control and after checking online regarding people having issues with LoanCare LLC, I found hundreds if not thousands of complains. XXXX alone had hundreds. Many were similar, if not identical, to the situation involving myself. Some even indicate that the process even went to filing a foreclosure on people. Also I found indications of class action suits etc. Since my credit rating had been destroyed, and now I'm facing the potential of foreclosure, I had to make a terrifying decision. I needed to get away from this company before my entire life was destroyed. I felt my only recourse was to pay off the loan to get clear of this catastrophe. I'm XXXX years old and have worked for the last 25 years running XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This involved working 24/7/365. I had managed to save a little money to retire on. Paying off the mortgage would destroy my savings and take all security away from life. The credit rating affected my Insurance quotes, ability to borrow money if I had an unexpected catastrophe, and basically completely negatively affected my whole world. On XX/XX/2019 I went on LoanCares web site to determine what amount I needed to pay off the loan. There is a section with a loan payoff calculator to determine payoff amount. I tried this several times yet it would not work. I contacted LoanCares customer service by phone and requested a payoff amount. The rep. told me it would be sent within a few days. Never received it!! 

On XX/XX/2019 I received two letters from XXXX XXXX of LoanCare LLC. The first letter indicated that the XXXX payment was applied to my account as I stipulated by supplying copies of the payment check. Thus I was completely exonerated. The late fees were removed from my account. The second letter indicated that my credit would be updated in 30 to 90 days. IT WASN'T!!!!! Also in the second letter I was advised that my past payment history up to XXXX was "" current with no delinquencies ''. 
 Finally things seem to be fixed. 

I calculated the payoff amount on my own. I sent a cashiers check to LoanCare and it was received on XX/XX/2019. 

On XX/XX/2019 I received a notice that I was 2 payments behind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was just 5 days past being told everything was fixed. On XX/XX/2019 I received another notice that I missed a payment, 8 days after being told all was taken care of. 

On XX/XX/2019 My payoff check was returned. I was informed that it was an incorrect amount. FINALLY I was provided with a payoff statement with this rejection letter. The payoff statement included a {$28.00} processing/recording fee AND {$36.00} LATE CHARGE FEE. The very same fee that LoanCares representative XXXX XXXX said was removed in her letter of XX/XX/2019. Reluctantly I made the payoff just to get clear of this clown circus before my entire world was destroyed. As will be stated later in this complaint I also dispute the {$28.00} processing fee since my loan was never processed or recorded. 

A LoanCare letter received on XX/XX/2019 acknowledged the loan payoff. Also noted in the letter was the statement "" We will forward the satisfaction/release of mortgage to the courthouse for proper removal of lien ''. As of this writing I have not received any paperwork such as notice of payoff on lien, Deed of Trust etc.. 

On XX/XX/2019 I sent an e-mail through the LoanCare web site requesting paperwork substantiating that my loan was paid and the proper paperwork would be provided to me. On XX/XX/2019 I received an e-mail stating that I needed to allow up to 120 days for the release of those documents. It has exceeded that time frame as of this writing. Upon doing research for this letter I discovered that the Colorado Revised Statute 38-35-124, ( Requirements upon satisfaction of indebtedness ), requires satisfaction of an indebtedness needs to be completed within 90 days. I now contest the processing fee charged since LoneCare neglected to actually process the release of loan. 

The final boondoggle was the receipt of their standard "" beg off '' ( or as I prefer to call it a "" lets give the customer a XXXX  letter '' ) saying they received a notice of error ( never stating what the original notice was about ) on XX/XX/2019. Note : this was over 2 months past the time the loan was paid off. These XXXX  letters seem to be LoanCare 's standard response to any issue. It does not indicate the initial issue and are sent out well beyond the initial complaint. Thus creating a completely foggy idea as to what they are referring to. When I researched this company online this standard form or XXXX  letter seemed to be the response to any and all complaints and issues. The intriguing part of the XXXX  response was that I received it on XX/XX/2019 TWO MONTHS past paying the loan off. I have no idea what prompted this XXXX  letter. These folks seem to send this XXXX  letter out like candy. Obviously they have no notion about what they are doing. 

CONSEQUENCES : 1 ) LoanCare LLC has unjustifiably and completely destroyed my credit rating. Their idea of a fix was to wait months to see if it recovers. To me that is completely unacceptable. 

2 ) LoanCare LLC has stolen money from me in the amount of {$36.00}. By their own admission, in the letter of XX/XX/2019, "" NO DELINQUENCIES '' exist. Yet, they decided to add that amount as a delinquency erroneously into the final payoff statement. 

3 ) LoanCare LLC has forced me to send numerous copies of checks to them to prove I made payments. The check copies indicate all payments were on time. Thus LoanCare should have to reimburse me for the expense they incurred on me without justification. They were in possession of their records indicating that the payments were made. Even their web site showing the accounting for the loan indicated the payments were made. Forcing me to justify them was ludicrous. The accounting is as follows. Initial letter with copies of checks {$0.00}, 2 traceable mailings of check copies at {$7.00} each totaling {$14.00},,,,,,,,,, for a grand total of {$15.00}. 

4 ) LoanCare LLC charged me {$28.00} fee for processing the paperwork to close the loan. I have not received my deed so obviously a fee for processing it is absurd.

5 ) I have recently tried to buy auto insurance. I was repeated asked by numerous Insurance Companies about my credit rating. Since LoanCare LLC has destroyed my credit rating I'm sure there is a detriment that I will suffer because of LoanCare LLC. Not to mention all the other life experiences that are affected by ones credit rating.

6 ) The damage to me is incalculable. LoanCare LLC has destroyed my retirement. I spent the last 25 years running XXXX XXXX XXXX 24/7/365. Over that time I was able to squirrel away a frugal amount of money so that I could retire and be able to survive. Since I'm now on a very fixed income my little savings was the only security knowing I could endure/survive an economic issue. Since I had to almost completely drain my meager savings to pay off this loan to avoid the results of a rogue loan processor I no longer can endure even the most mundane of economic issues. If, for example, I need to replace the engine in my 20+ year old pickup truck, that has XXXX miles on it, I now have to worry about eating, or fixing my truck. LoanCare LLC has completely destroyed my future security. I'm XXXX years old with a XXXX XXXX XXXX who now has to try to find work or a way to regain what little security I had. Since LoanCare LLC destroyed my credit rating, and having a fixed limited income, trying to refinance my house would be economic suicide.

They were both owned by US Bank, but one was a Visa and the other was an XXXX XXXX. The Visa department had no issue with working with me and keeping the same arrangement and terms. They were willing to refund the fees and interest as well as reduce the APR. They were understanding of the fact that if not for the lack of actions by the debt counseling program I would have made timely payments. I started out owing them over {$1100.00} and currently owe them {$550.00}. The XXXX XXXX division refused to work with me. They basically said that they did not care why the payments were not made that the fees would stand. Additionally, they would not keep the terms that they had previously agreed with the debt counseling program with me. I continued to call them and battle with them and eventually they sold off the account. At that time I received correspondence from two entities claiming that I owed them for this account. XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I called both explaining to them the previous circumstances and that I needed something in writing stating that they were the owner of the debt. They basically laughed at me, mocked me and threatened me with suing me and ruining my credit, which was already being done. I left voice messages, I clicked on the contact us button on XXXX website leaving messages regarding the situation. When I would call they would route my call to the same guy and he would harass me by speaking down to me and asking me many questions to verify who I was and some I was not comfortable with answering or did I think was necessary, especially since they were not willing to verify their position or control of the debt, therefore he would proclaim that he could not tell me ANYTHING and would end the call.

"Not sure that the options selected really fit this scenario but they were the best fit based on what was available. I have a Southwest Airlines rewards card with Chase.

In recent weeks I have been paying off credit card balances including this one. I paid it down to XXXX in one lump payment. There has not been a major change in my credit score or report.

I know that this is their right, but this was done without repayment being an issue ( no slow pays on this account ) that can be verified on my credit report ) and I would argue evidence of lower risk since I just paid the entire card off. My real complaint here is that has a negative impact on my credit. As I am paying cards down and off and reducing % of credit used this move by Chase has negatively impacted that and I know that I will see my score decrease a bit in coming days by no action of my own. They also did this recently to my wife. We have not experienced this with any other creditor. I could see this action if there had been negative activity on the account or a significant change in credit score. This appears to be penalizing me for reducing my balance, therefore reducing the interest that I am paying.

"EQUIFAX and Dispute Process Equifax Confirmation # XXXX, I have recently pulled my credit report and identified an unauthorized request to pull my credit which is considered hard hits to my credit report.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX within a six month period pulled my credit report XXXX times without my authorization and then the credit union was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who also pulled my credit report without my permission.

They stated because they have my credit information they can pull my credit report at any time. I questioned this because that means they are saying anyone who has my information can pull my credit and become a hard hit without my authorization and it counts against me. The statement made no sense. I then asked in their re-investigation did they ask the credit union to provide authorization by me to pull my credit report and provide proof from the consumer of this request, should n't I have been notified. Equifax response is they have no control on what is reported, so I asked then what are your investigation if "" I '' the consumer is saying it 's authorized and fraudulent. The action seems to be an improper business practice by the credit union and lack of investigation into that accuracy of data from the credit reporting agency Equifax.

"This is in response to the lawsuit filed against Navient regarding their practices. 

About a two years ago, due to finally having decently steady employment, I reached out to Navient in order to get on an Income-Based Repayment plan. During this process I ended up having to speak with around six different people on six different occasions, often receiving contradictory advice.
The first one said that my repayment options were limited to two particular plans ( both being much higher than the others offered ).
I called back a week later, not happy with the previous conversation, only to be told by a different Navient employee that all I needed to do  was fill out this particular form online, send it in, and I would be approved for the more reasonable repayment plan. I did this and received a notice that I had been rejected/declined from that repayment plan. 

Due to this I was a bit confused and called Navient again. I spoke with another Navient employee who told me I should have been approved and to do the same process again ( fill out the form online and send it in ) and it would go through properly this time. The employee stated that is was likely a mistake in the system and that they would get it fixed. I again filled out the online form and sent it in only to again receive another denial letter a week or so later. 

I called back a fourth time, frustrated and confused. In speaking with another Navient employee I was told that I needed to resubmit the online form again but this time with some extra information requested. I was assured by the employee this would be sorted out this time. Again, about a week later I received another denial letter from Navient. 

I called Navient for a fifth time and spoke with another Navient employee. That employee said something along the lines of, "" I do n't know what those other people were talking about, you are not eligible for the repayment plan you are seeking. '' Finally, very frustrated and confused I called back a sixth time and elected to defer my loans for a year because I could n't afford the payments Navient was expecting.

Citi, was always eager to close my account, i never experience nothing like this before and usually, when a client don't make payments for 30/60/120 the creditor close the account for non-payment or when is fraud but not something like this. Earlier this year I experienced some financial difficulties with work and my checking account was comprised for some few weeks but the problem is fixed with my bank.

This supposed support was said to include help getting connected to employers that the school had a relationship with and being referred to full-time well paying positions. These two reason were pivotal to me deciding to attend the school. Upon completing the program, I sought to receive career help. The only support I received from the school was to get connected with a few temporary part-time gigs. While I took these opportunities, I continued to see if they would be able to connect me with full-time opportunities, as they promised.

She also told me to get things figured out as soon as possible because if we could get the release of the lien they would have to receive it no later that Friday, XX/XX/XXXX because the legal documents department ( that handles these issues ) does not work on the weekend so we need to get it so we can get our money. I called the number it and was the child support division that placed the lien for past due child support that my husband owed ( he went through a 9 month unemployment period while I was on doctor ordered bedrest due to complications with my XXXX last year, but recently started working again and his new job is working on implementing the garnishment to pull his monthly support directly from his paycheck ). I asked what could be done since I was now without any funds to buy food for my children, put gas in my car for work, or pay any bills and that my paycheck of {$930.00}, which was scheduled to be direct deposited on XX/XX/XXXX, would not be enough to get us out of the negative balance the lien had us in. The child support office said that if we agreed to pay {$200.00} they would release the lien. Of course we agreed to that amount and the child support office jumped through hoops to get me the agreement, my husband and I both signed the necessary paperwork saying we agreed to pay {$200.00}, and returned the signed agreement to the child support office. They confirmed with me that they received the documentation and then confirmed that they sent the release of the lien over to Bank of America so they could get us our money. I called Bank of America again Thursday evening to see if they had received the release of lien paperwork from child support yet. They said they didn't see it yet, but because it was so late to call first thing Friday morning. The rep again reiterated that I had to make sure they received the release of lien Friday morning because the legal document department didn't work on the weekend. She also told me that once the legal department had the release they would be able to expedite the process to get us our money. At XXXX on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX I started calling Bank of America . At this point my paycheck had been deposited and we were showing negative {$980.00} dollars. There was an automated message saying they had a higher than normal call volume and I could receive a call back in 11-15 min. I agreed. I received my callback 15 min later and it connected me to another associate. I had to explain EVERYTHING to her again and she told me she understood and that she needed to place me on hold to contact the legal documents department to see what was going on. She placed me on hold, after almost 10 minutes on hold, it disconnected the call. I called Bank of America back again and this time was told I could receive a call back between 19-22 min later. Nearly 20 minutes later I received the callback. I had to explain everything to the new representative AGAIN. She told me she understood completely and that she had to place me on hold again to contact that department. She placed me on hold ( for a long time ) and when she finally came back she stated that the legal documents department did, in fact, receive the release of lien paperwork from the child support office. She stated that under normal circumstances it takes 3-5 business days for them to process the release of lien paperwork. I adamantly explained to her that have a XXXX year old, a XXXX year old, and a XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX at home that I literally had no food for and that my husband and I were both almost out of gas in our vehicles. I asked if there was any way she could speak with the legal team and ask for the process to be expedited to release the funds that same day. She placed me back on hold and was gone even longer. When she returned she stated that the legal team agreed to expedite the process and that my funds would be available to us within 24 hours. I asked her multiple times if she was absolutely sure the funds would be available within 24 hours because the next day was Saturday and not a business day and I had already been told that the legal team didn't work on Saturday or Sunday. She promised multiple times that yes, the money would absolutely be available Saturday morning. I said ok, I would be able to make it through the night. Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my bank account app ( on my mobile phone ) and was still negative {$980.00}. I immediately called Bank of America back. I had to explain everything again ( including that the rep the day before had PROMISED, multiple times, that my money would be available Saturday morning. The rep said that although she understands my frustration and my fear of not being able to feed my children, that there was likely nothing that could be done because the legal department wasn't there on the weekend. I told her I knew about the legal department already, but that I was specifically promised, multiple times, that the funds would for sure be available in the account Saturday morning. She placed me on hold saying she would try to see if there was any other group that could release the lien. She came back saying there wasn't. I ended up asking to speak to a supervisor. I was on hold for over 30 min waiting for a supervisor to pick up the phone. When a supervisor finally picked up, she introduced herself as XXXX ( ID : XXXX ). I had to explain my situation again. After going back and forth with her, she started getting an attitude with me ( and yes, I was VERY upset during this situation, but that should be understood given the circumstances ), she basically told me there was nothing that could be done and I would just have to wait until they processed everything. I asked how to file a formal complaint. She said she had already escalated it to corporate and send the information to the representative 's manager ( that I spoke with Friday that made the promise ) for coaching. I told her that team member either put me on hold just to make up a complete lie about my money to get me off the phone, or she really did contact the legal department and they told her a complete lie. I also told her that forwarding the issue to the direct manager did me absolutely no good when I had no food or gas for an entire weekend. I asked her how I file a formal complaint because this needed to be brought higher up. She said well any formal complaint has to be in writing. I then had to ask for the address for her corporate office. She told me to write to : Bank of America XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX She then went on to end the call by saying sorry, while not sounding very sorry at all. I literally had to call my parents IN XXXX and they were able to order us an electronic giftcard for a local grocery store so that we could get enough food to get through the weekend and a little gas in the car to get us through the first day or 2 of the next week. Monday, XX/XX/XXXX came and now we were negative {$1200.00} because my car insurance payment was pending and Bank of America still did not process the release. They also did not contact me with anything they needed from us. My husband and I thought that surely, after all of the promises from the bank and all of the phone calls, Tuesday morning the situation would be resolved. At this point we were also behind on paying for daycare because we had no available money to pay. I logged into my bank account first this Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX and now we were negative {$1200.00} because Bank of America had assessed a {$35.00} nonsufficient fund fee because of the car insurance payment that posted to the account. They posted this fee even though the lien is a "" pending '' transaction and not a "" posted '' transaction so no fee should have been applied. I tried getting through to someone at XXXX, but they were once again experiencing a high than normal call volume and I was at work so I could not wait. I checked my account continuously throughout the morning hoping the money would be made available and the {$35.00} NSF fee would be returned to us, with no luck. At XXXX I called and once again received the "" higher than normal call volume '' and offered a callback in 10-15 minutes. I received the callback at XXXX. I spoke with a rep named XXXX and had to explain everything AGAIN. She said she would make sure the legal department received the release of lien. I told her that was already confirmed, I needed to know why it wasn't completed on Friday ( for Saturday ) as promised and when my funds would be available. She placed me on hold for a long period of time. When she came back she told me that the associate in the legal documents department told her that they were waiting on us to submit signature cards to them because they didn't have any on file and could not verify our signatures on the lien release agreement that the child support department sent them. I asked her why I had not received a phone call about this and why when I had been calling Bank of America since Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX no one mentioned to me that they didn't have my signature or my husband 's signature on file and they would need them in order to process the release of lien. She told me she didn't know. I also stated that I found it odd they didn't need my or my husband 's signature to put the lien on the account, but now needed it to remove the lien? She didn't have an answer. I asked what I needed to do now. She stated that now ( even though we have very little gas in our cars ) my husband and I need to both go in to one of their financial centers ( a branch office ) and sign signature cards, the branch would have to fax it to the legal documents department, and once they verified the signatures they could expedite the completion. I had to take time off from my job to drive to a banking center ( my husband had to meet me there ). We spoke with the branch manager at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, TX XXXX location. We had to again explain what was going on ( even though XXXX stated she would notate the account, but per the manager we spoke with she said they can not see the same notes that the call center reps can see. This is incredibly inefficient ). The manager was helpful, verified our identities, printed out signature cards that my husband and I both signed. She then went to fax it to the legal document department and I returned to work. My husband stayed at the branch until he received the confirmation print out that the fax was sent and the manager called and confirmed that the fax was received. She also asked that they now expedite the process as we had been promised it would be last week and again this morning. My husband returned home and called Bank of America again to validate again that they received our signature cards and to get an exact timeframe that our money would be available. He was told that it would be an additional 3 to 5 business days before they would process the release of lien. Even though we were promise it would be expedited, even though we had been working on this since XX/XX/XXXX. The rep he spoke with was incredibly rude and continually told him that this was our fault because it was his child support and that we only turned in the release today. He continually told her that he understands his child support obligations and that this no longer had anything to do with child support since they had ensured the bank received the release last week Thursday and he told her that we had made sure the release was there last week ( and had confirmed this over multiple phone calls ). She was incredibly rude and disrespectful to him and when he said that this was unacceptable she told him he would have to accept it. Even though my husband continuously told the rep that Bank of America had received the release of lien paperwork last week and what they received today was the signature cards ( that no one had informed us they needed until I called today ), she continued to say this is our fault and that they would not be expediting it. Since they are refusing to release the lien my parents had to XXXX XXXX us {$500.00} to cover the cost of daycare and ensure that we had food and gas the rest of the week, and because of this they had to pay {$49.00} to get the money to us. I just checked my bank account again at XXXX and now we are negative {$1000.00} because they decided to not honor our car insurance payment ( so that money was put back in our account, but they are still charging us the $ XXXXNSF fee ). Now I have to worry about my car insurance being cancelled even though I technically have {$900.00} in my account. They should have never does this. They have now continuously harmed my family, have been completely rude and disrespectful, and are refusing to make this right. Now my family is potentially without our hard earned money ( from my paycheck ) until Monday or Tuesday of next week ( XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) which means I will also have to pay my rent late have excessive amounts of late fees levied against me. I have already informed Bank of America that once my money is available to me I will be withdrawing all of it and going to a different financial institution. I will also be moving my direct deposits and as soon as I am clear of this bank, I will be closing my account with them that I have had for several years now.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

In addition, I sent TransUnion and XXXX  letters reporting this account had now been re-inserted onto my profile and my concern regarding this dispute being opened, disputed and updated as if it were initiated by me?

At what point will XXXX  be held accountable for their violations and the destruction they continue to do to my credit with such erroneous reporting?

I have called Paypal over 25 times at this point, starting from when I first discovered the transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and they can not find any information about the transactions using my bank account and routing number. 

XXXX has denied my appeals saying that I authorized these transactions to Paypal.I have gone into multiple branches, which has proven useless, as the representatives call the same fraud number and they also get the runaround. Since there is no direct number, I have spent hours on the phone with XXXX and Paypal, repeating my story each time to every representative I talk to, then I get transferred to the dispute department, then the dispute department tells me to file another appeal and then my heart sinks again with anxiety each time I get another denial, saying "" an established device was used '' and "" activity is not consistent with fraud '' when I clearly said this was fraudulent before the last transaction cleared. I am not understanding how every time I call Paypal they can not find any transaction linked to my XXXX accounts, along with the "" Paypal account '' listed in the XXXX document ( per XXXX this Paypal account used to "" add funds '' was established in XXXX ), yet this is inconsistent with fraud per XXXX.

Considering that you contacted us the day before, there was no payment on file to stop.

I have also requested more information about the specific device that was used to "" authorize '' these transactions and when/if these notifications went out ( I received no alerts whatsoever and have also asked when the contact information on my account was changed ), however XXXX continues to provide the most vague information. I also asked for IMEI, IP address, or exactly how/when these transactions were "" authorized. '' They provided me with an IP address located in XXXX but I believe the first transaction may have cleared before I was in XXXX, but since they didn't give an IP for each transaction, I can't prove that for sure. 

I have filed complaints to CFPB ( with XXXX ), IC3, my local police, OCC, FDIC, FTC, yet XXXX assumes no responsibility. XXXX has taken 15 agonizing business days to get back to me via snail mail ( nope, no email or phone call in XXXX ). I have received ONE phone call from a XXXX representative to investigate my case after several appeals, countless calls and emails. It is outrageous that XXXX is disgustingly apathetic when one of their customers lost {$20000.00} under their care. On XXXX, they stated "" with this final letter, we consider the issue resolved.

On XX/XX/XXXX, a representative from the office of the President 's Executive Branch said they will no longer respond to my inquiries and they could not conduct a three-way call. 

After exhausting all resources with XXXX, Paypal must have more information about these claims or at least communicate with XXXX that these claims are clearly fraud. I was told that there might be a third party involved in ACH transfers, if so, I need more information about all of these transactions. I am really not understanding how Paypal can not find any information about these transactions with the documents provided from XXXX.

"I have been an American Express Platinum  Delta SkyMiles card user for 15+ years with an average card spend of $ XXXX/year while paying the $ XXXX/year annual membership fee. Yet Amex did not treat me fairly or equitably. 

I always pay off my entire balance each month and in all these years, I had never had a late payment! Never that is, until about 7 months ago when I decided to sign up for eBills ( Autopay ) service via XXXX XXXX. When I first signed up, eBills failed due to which I had my first late payment ever with Amex in 15+ years as a platinum  customer. At that time, when I called customer service, Amex DID reverse my late fee and interest accrued ( about {$150.00} ), for the first time EVER on my account. 

After that first mishap, eBills seemed to work well and everything was good with paying off the card automatically each month. However, I noticed today, while scanning charges on my Amex card after a recent trip, that I had accrued serious interest charges which I should not have given that I pay the balance off in full each month. 

Turns out, XXXX XXXX does not consider Saturday a business day ( which is the case with most banks ) but Amex DOES consider it a business day, at least for the purposes of payment due dates and penalties. My eBills was setup to send payment 2 business days prior to the due date for each of my credit cards, because that is how long it takes XXXX XXXX to process the bill pay. For the XXXX Amex payment however, the due date fell on a Saturday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), so when XXXX XXXX auto paid on Thursday ( XX/XX/XXXX ), Amex did not receive it until Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Since XXXX XXXX does not consider Saturday or Sunday a business day, the payment was not delivered to Amex until the next business day which was Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 

This resulted in Amex charging me $ 590+ in accrued interest and late fees. Of course I called them. But despite speaking with several managers, they REFUSED to reverse anything because they had reversed the charges for the only other instance when I had been late, mentioned above, in XX/XX/XXXX!! 

After all these years as a premium customer with never a late payment, that Amex has made tons of money off of via transaction fees and annual membership fees, this is where we are.

After closing, a maintenance fee was applied which, I was told, reopened my account unbeknownst to me.

"On XXXX I went to XXXX XXXX located in XXXX TX to purchase a vehicle. I purchased the 2017 XXXX XXXX vehicle and it was financed through Wells Fargo in the amount of {$20000.00} at 5.09 % interest rate. After I purchased the vehicle a few weeks later I contacted Wells Fargo to go over the invoice that the dealership had submitted to them sine I didn't get a welcome call from Wells Fargo. I was informed by the agent that the dealership added a Luggage Rack, Tow Package and Fixed Running Boards to the amount of my loan. I informed the agent that I did not have these options on my vehicle. He stated that if I didn't have these options than the amount that was financed is incorrect, it should have been less. I was instructed to contact Wells Fargo ECR dept which I did. The agent went over the invoice again and I again told the agent that I did not have these options. The agent stated a case would be opened and not to contact the dealership as they would do so. And if I had pictures of my vehicle to email them to XXXX which I did send the pictures. Around XX/XX/XXXX I called Wells Fargo to make sure the pictures were received. I was told no however, I needed to speak with my assigned rep by the name of XXXX. I spoke to XXXX and she confirmed that they did not receive my pictures and to email them to her personal email address which again I sent the pictures of the vehicle. I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that my concerns were being researched and that I should receive an answer on or before XX/XX/XXXX as my first payment to Wells Fargo was due on the XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have paid my monthly payment however, I have not heard back from Wells Fargo. I have emailed them and left messages. I am paying for items that I do not have on my vehicle and Wells Fargo is benefiting from the deception of the dealership. I've asked that the loan in the amount of {$20000.00} be re-calculated at the correct amount for the correct features of my vehicle however, nothing has been done. My monthly payment would be less had the dealer not committed this fraudulent act. I also believe that the dealership inflated the price of the vehicle by added work for tinted windows. I was told by the salesperson that the tinted windows were something that the dealership added to the vehicle, and that this was an option that couldn't be removed. I later checked and found out that tinted windows aka privacy windows is a standard feature for the trim level of my vehicle. I am sure that I'm not the first customer that this has happened too. I am told that this happens all the time ; that dealers inflate the cost of the deal then push it to the financial institutions who are aware that this goes on and they only do something when the vehicle is repo 'd and they are attempting to sell the vehicle. They then go after the dealership for the money that was charged for the non existing equipment. I do not feel that this is a fair practice and it is very deceptive to the consumers.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"I went through the pre-approval process at a local jeweler to see the amount of a loan I could get approved through Wells Fargo for an engagement ring. Neither the paperwork or the jeweler ever mentioned opening an account with Wells Fargo, and I left the jewelry store that day without making a purchase and without ever speaking with Wells Fargo to open the account. About a month later, I received a credit score that mentioned I had a line of credit that had been open for about a month. While I was confused at the time, it sounds very similar to what has happened with many consumers that have been scammed by Wells Fargo. At the time, I called Wells Fargo to close the account and clear up the confusion - and even mentioned that the account was opened without my knowledge. The representative on the phone said there was nothing they could do to clear the account off of my record.

"To whom it may concern, Id like to report my current student loan lender, AES, of unfair practices and creating a false narrative in order to make me pay more money than what is actually owed. Originally this loan should have been settled along with my other private student loans back in XXXX. 

Around mid-late XX/XX/XXXX, I started receiving phone calls from AES. They told me I owed around {$600.00} as payment for a student loan. I explained that all of my loans were settled through the courts and Ive been faithfully making monthly payments since the settlement. Their representative stated my school, XXXX XXXX University, had contacted them directly and personally on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them my estimated graduation date had changed to XX/XX/XXXX for this particular loan. She also mentioned a website called XXXX XXXX XXXX had me listed on there with the same estimated graduation date of XX/XX/XXXX. From there I asked the AES representative questions to which I could not get a direct answer. 
These questions consisted of If my graduation date was XX/XX/XXXX, why would my school directly contact you XX/XX/XXXX to say my estimated graduation was XX/XX/XXXX?, How can AES grant me a forbearance I didnt request?, Why did my school contact you only in reference to that particular loan and not the others who were taken out within that same school year by the same company?, Why was this not apart of the original settlement since all the private loans were taken out within the same school year, what made this loan different from the others?, etc. I also asked why was I just now being notified by phone. The representative stated AES has been sending me notifications to a paperless inbox on their website. I told them I never opted for paperless communication, I always received letters in the mail for updates and request, and my phone never changed since I first had it back in XXXX. 

As a matter of fact, the paper letters stopped coming way before I settled my case with National Collegiate Trust XXXX whom AES gave my loans too for collections ). As for AES, I always made sure they had up to date information so I could be notified of any changes. I asked the representative if I could have an extension on the billing due date since I didnt have the immediate funds. She stated I was not eligible. I was then advised to contact the original lender, XXXX XXXX to see what could be done for payment. I asked for a contact number, she would not give it to me. XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up my original loan information, called around, and was finally able to get in touch with XXXX XXXX  student loan department. The only help they could offer was another forbearance, which I turned town. From there, I was sent to my local XXXXXXXX XXXX branch where I set up a one on one meeting to discuss my issue with the loan and possible repayment options. 
The bank representative was unable to help me with repayment options due to the loan being in forbearance even though that was a mistake on AESs behalf. He gave me a number to their student loan investigation department and stated I would be eligible for refinancing within 3 months of payments in full. He also calculated the amount of additional interest accrued rom the forbearance from XXXX. This came up to over {$12000.00}. 

The way this loan was handled was and is very unprofessional. Someone along the line made a huge mistake that is physically costing me additional money. I would like this investigated. 

FYI, a brief loan history background : During the academic year XXXX, I took out a series of private loans during my freshman year at XXXX XXXX University due to me not being eligible for financial aid. All private loans originated from XXXX XXXX XXXX whose guarantor was XXXX. Once the recession hit, my private loans were all sold off to AES. AES did not abide by XXXX original contract and came after me for payments ( for all loans ) during my last year in college ( XXXX ). I graduated XX/XX/XXXX. I was working low level jobs and cold not make adequate payments. This forced my loans into default. From there the loans were given to National Collegiate Trust who sued me. I originally hired a lawyer through XXXX. I turned in all my loan documentation, including the one included in this letter. She ended up getting a new job while working with me and left the company in the middle of my case. From there, I located another lawyer who helped me settle. The debtor who I make my monthly payments too is XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX. Since the settlement, Ive made payments faithfully. Attached is my personal documentation, XXXX XXXX XXXX documentation, and documentation directly from AES. 
In reference to this loan XX/XX/XXXX the loan went into repayment status, XX/XX/XXXX the loan went into deferrement, XX/XX/XXXX the grace period ended.",Student loan

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA.

I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report.

My information was amongst those affected by the data breach and I already know of one erroneous item on my credit report ( which I had corrected with the other agencies in less than 24 hours ). I can't dispute the account without a confirmation number from a credit report they won't give me.

I've tried the phone number but there is no option to talk to a live person so it tells me it can't help me.

"AMERICAS BIGGEST SCAM TO EACH CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY, XXXX, EQUIFAX AND XXXX XXXX RESPECTIVELY : A scam is being presented to each credit reporting agency in millions of cases. The Federal Trade Commission agreed years ago that the debt collection business is broken, and now, because of a loosely held Supreme Court decision, the debt collection industry has gone off the charts on illegal activity of the transfer of trade for personal credit matters. Each of these violations where proof of ownership is not sustained is a serious breach of an implied agreement between the collection agencies and the credit bureaus through the subscriber agreement between the parties. Your credit reporting agency needs to investigate this abusive practice and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) must initiate a serious investigation on this abusive practice. My files should be purged permanently as the fraud has already been committed, and I am subject to my rights to sue for damages. 
I am one of millions of American consumers who has been entwined into a scam by various collection agencies in America. Attached is a document known as a qualified written request or QWR. There are several posted collections on this QWR, all with account numbers backed by copies of collections from XXXX XXXX. On each of these collection notices it specifically states that XXXX XXXX is the new owner of a debt or debts that were originally with another creditor. However, a fully completed QWR on each of these debts will prove that not only is XXXX XXXX the new owner, but that any transfer would have been illegal unless said transfer came from a securitized trust agreement. All of these debts were sold off into a trust, and the QWR for each debt will prove so. Now Ill explain how this scam originated in the United Stated over the past year. 
On XX/XX/2017 a decision was handed down in the United States Supreme Court on a case called XXXX ET AL v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This 11-page decision comes right to the point on the application of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), the rights consumers should have under this act, and the tracking of new ownership. This decision left a window open for the debt collection agencies and their counterpart original creditors to pass off charged off debts without the proper documented trail. The decision states that a buyer of debt ( s ) can work outside the FDCPA protections guaranteed to consumers. 
The problem is becoming a giant problem pertaining to trade rights for Americans who should be protected under FDCPA. Im making the claim that each and every one of these collection has perpetuated a fraudulent activity that should be beyond a civil complaint, but more criminal in nature. 
XXXX XXXX has never acquired these debts legally. There was no tracking of the debts from originality to a securitized trust, and from a trust with multiple signatures to XXXX XXXX. This process is not only fraudulent, but a process that has caused me great damage to my personal credit history. This agency is now doing this process to virtually millions of Americans amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in fraudulent collections. 
COLLECTION AGENCY HAS NO SUBMITTED PROOP OF OWNERSHIP!

"I have been a Discover credit card member since 2005. Several years ago, I used the card to purchase home improvement material. The monthly payments were being made on time. However, after making payments for some time, Discover representative informed me that the low promotional interest rate would now change to higher interest rate. While I tried to explain this promotional rate should remain, they would not hear of it and raised my rate to around 9 %. After another year of making on time payments, Discovered called again and raised the interest rate a second time to around 16 %. I objected to raising the rate on purchases that were initially made on a low promotional rate offer. In addition, for no reason provided, Discover significantly reduced my limits on the card to the balance remaining further preventing me to purchase on the card. I continued to make on time payments, and once again Discover reduced the limit to balance remaining. This practice of reducing limits continued as the principal was paid down. I objected that if I am making on time payments at higher rates and never late, why the reduction in credit limit. The bank stated that this was their normal practice based on review of my credit card statement. Again, I had no choice but to continue to make monthly payments on a higher interest rate. Finally as recently as a year ago, the rate was once again raised to 21 % and the credit limit was once again reduced. I believe the bank is illegally changing terms in the middle of the contract and continuing to raise interest rate higher than those offered by competing banks. Also, Discover continues to reduce my credit card limit although payments are always made on time. This is not a fair bank practice and in my opinion illegal. A loyal customers like myself who has been with this bank since 2005 should not be taken advantage of and who has demonstrated good on time payment history. Because the bank unreasonably increased my rates several times and reduced my limit several times, these actions by Discover has placed undue hardship on me and my family, taken advantage of my financial situation, and in my opinion is an illegal practice.",Credit card or prepaid card

"To Whom It May Concern : I have an auto loan through PNC Bank, and I have an issue with a late payment doe to PNC Bank not setting up my automatic payments in a timely matter, and significantly longer than they stated. 

My PNC Bank auto loan started XX/XX/XXXX. Payments are due the 25th of each month. As soon as I received the appropriate paperwork, I sent out the following information on XX/XX/XXXX : A check for XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX payments - to the PNC Bank Loan center The needed paperwork to set up automatic payments from my bank account - To the processing center address Please note that these two items were sent to TWO different locations, as per the instructions PNC Bank gave my upon setup of my loan. 

The attached DOCUMENT 1 is the form that I filled out to set up automatic payments from my bank account. On the form, it states that it will take approximately 30 days for the system to be set up. DOCUMENT 2 is a copy of the check that I sent on XX/XX/XXXX, paying for XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX payments, as I was allowing for this 30 day set up period. DOCUMENT 3 shows that this check was received and deposited XX/XX/XXXX. I can also provide a copy of my checkbook register. 

Since I sent the check and the automatic payment letters at the same time ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I assumed that as the start date for the approximately 30 days it would take to set up my automatic payments. I assumed that a large bank with a reputation like PNC would have taken care of my automatic payments by my next payment due date ( being XX/XX/XXXX, over 50 days after I sent my paperwork in ) Towards the end of XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from PNC Bank that my auto loan payment was late. Upon learning this, I immediately paid my balance, but I attempted to determine my money was not automatically withdrawn from my bank account. I have funds moving through my account all the time, and I did not notice that my car payment wasn't being withdrawn. I was also working under the assumption that I had be before, in that PNC was a professional bank and they would have been able to process my payment information. 

PNC Bank was not helpful to my situation. They claimed to have launched an investigation concerning my late payment, to which they determined that the payment was indeed late. However, I was not debating that the payment was late, but that it was late because PNC Bank did not process my automatic payment information in a timely matter, and thus didn't withdraw the money that I directed them to take out of my account to pay the balance of my loan. See DOCUMENT 4 for PNC Bank 's response to my dispute. 

After I debated this issue with PNC Bank, I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, claiming that my automatic payment information was received and that they would begin withdrawing money from my account XX/XX/XXXX. I received this letter over 100 days after I sent my application, for a start date over 110 days after I expected it to start. See DOCUMENT 5 for this letter. 

At this point, I felt I had exhausted my options, until I found out about the CFPB. I called PNC Bank last Tuesday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) to try and argue my dispute. I spoke with multiple PNC Executives, each sending me to their superior. Most recently, I dealt with the PNC Executive Client Relations Dept, where I was not helped, but found more disturbing news. First, the PNC representative said that they were unable to prove that I sent in my automatic withdrawl form in XX/XX/XXXX, despite that all my paperwork ( that PNC Bank is in possession of ) is signed and dated in XX/XX/XXXX. Also, since I sent that form in the mail, the mailing data on the envelope would have been dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

Secondly, the PNC Representative claims that I faxed the form in, and that is how they received it. I did not send the form twice, and I did not fax it. I have detailed my method of sending my automatic payment information, and I DID NOT fax it. I am extremely concerned by this, as I am not sure who had control of my information during the 100 days my form wasn't processed. 

PNC Bank did not process my automatic withdrawl payment paperwork for my auto loan in a timely matter, causing my to have a late payment and negatively impact my credit score for something that was not my fault. In addition, I am concerned that PNC Bank did not have control of my personal information during this entire process, opening me up to potential identity theft. At this point, I would like this negative mark removed from my credit, as PNC Bank did not process my paperwork in the amount of time specified in their paperwork.

"The Carrington mortgage servicing department, has created this problem. The first item which happened was the company placed me on the certified funds only payment plan. It takes two returned items to be placed on this list. The first time was substantiated to be a bank error approximately XX/XX/19, yet Carrington mortgage servicing choose to apply this to my record. Then I was told not to make a payment during a refinance process. So I set up a promise to pay on XX/XX/19, and there were not instructions to stop the direct payment when doing this process, at least in an area readily seen when doing this process. This process resulted in a 30 day late notation on my credit. So Carrington mortgage servicing department told me I need to western union my payments, this was an immediate posting process according to Carrington, and for a few payments it was. So with their actions another payment needed to be made due to another error in the refi process at Carrington mortgage, I had to make another payment via western union ( which I shouldnt be doing anyway ) which was made on XX/XX/19 and Carrington is posting on XX/XX/19, resulting in another 30 day infraction. This being said I attempted to resolve these issues with Carrington mortgage servicing department with extreme resistance on every level the errors were made. Carringtons actions have resulted in extreme issues further damaging my credit.",Mortgage
"I have had a loan in forbearance with Great Lakes Higher Education for about a year or more now. I am at a point where I can start making payments as I have recently become steadily employed and want to start paying these loans off. I have reached out to the servicer on multiple occasions to make a payment as I have a high amount of interest that has already accrued on the account I have. They keep asking me for my personal bank account information or telling me to go open a checking account somewhere as they will not accept credit card payments. I have a valid credit card I can pay with and I 'm not comfortable giving anyone direct access to my savings account ( I do n't have a checking account ). I have no other method of paying my student loans other than through a credit card. All I want to do is make a payments until the loan balance is paid off. There seems to be no flexibility at all on this and if I knew there were stipulations to getting my student loan that it can only be paid off with a direct link to some kind of a bank account at this point I would have just foregone my education entirely because now its likely going to ruin my credit and keep piling on interest.

"On XX/XX/2018, I found out on my credit report an incorrect account from PlusFour Inc. for past due amount of {$2800.00} as of XX/XX/2018. 
On XX/XX/2018, I disputed the collection account with XXXX  and XXXX. As of today, I received the report of the investigation done by XXXX  stating that the adverse account will remain on my credit report because PlusFour certified that information reported were accurate. All without providing me any written evidence by which PlusFour could support its false statement. 
After receiving the 'Collection Notice ' from PlusFour on XX/XX/2018 ( one and only written correspondence from PlusFour ), I disputed a validity of a debt by sending a certified mail letter on XX/XX/2018 to the address shown on the Collection Notice ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX , NV XXXX ). The same dispute letter was sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and to XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. While doctors ' office and XXXX accepted the letter sent to their notice, PlusFour REFUSED TO ACCEPT my letter disputing a validity of a debt! 
On XX/XX/2018, I resent the dispute of validity of a debt by sending the second certified mail letter to the address available on the PlusFour website ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NV XXXX-XXXX ), and the dispute letter was returned to me because an attempted delivery failed due to the addressee NOT KNOWN. PlusFour 's  website provides only the mailing address ; there is no online form that can be filled by people like me. 
If PlusFour accepted my letter disputing the validity of a debt, they would know that the charges for specialist in-patients visits that I NEVER REQUESTED were still under the review and an appeal of my insurance. 
I received the FIRST BILL from XXXX XXXX XXXX  at the end of XX/XX/2018! 
Based on my knowledge, the majority of the charges for 17 specialist in-patients visits were denied by my insurance because the doctor FAILED to obtain ( not once, but 17 times!!! ) a pre-certification for his repeated UNILATERAL non-emergency visits. Based on my records, my insurance after all re-processed all claims after my second appeal ( considering my serious health situation and hardship ) for 17 NON-EMERGENCY specialist in-patient visits that I NEVER requested!!! 
On XX/XX/2018, my wife called the billing department for XXXX  XXXX XXXX  to learn why I received the bill from their doctor, and she explained the whole situation with the review and a filed appeal with my insurance and my intention to wait for the result of the appeal for the charges for 17 specialist in-patient visits that I never requested. They were aware the appeal could take 45-60 days to be processed if not longer. 
Based on my records, my insurance processed the claims and paid to XXXX  XXXX XXXX {$680.00} by sending checks in XX/XX/2018. 
Around the middle of XX/XX/2018, XXXX  XXXX XXXX  sent me a new bill for {$550.00} ( with costs of services {$2700.00}, showing an adjusted amount of {$1500.00}, and being paid {$680.00} by my insurance ). The bill generated on XX/XX/2018 is a proof that I did not owe {$2700.00} to XXXX  XXXX XXXX as PlusFour continues falsely reporting to credit bureau agencies and even falsely reported to XXXX  the accuracy of that information on XX/XX/2018, in a response to my dispute with XXXX! 
On XX/XX/2018, I replied to the bill ( through certified mail ) with a letter requesting from XXXX  XXXX XXXX  evidence of 17 specialist in-patient visits and medical notes/reports/test results, etc. that were allegedly provided every 3-4 days, and for which I am allegedly responsible to pay copayments ( including to provide me the name of the XXXX  employee that arranged for those specialist in-patient visits, without telling me or asking for my approval ). I didn't see any doctor visiting me 17 times during my stay at XXXX. 
As a patient, I am ENTITLED to an explanation and understanding for what and why I was billed. In my opinion, doctors should not be allowed to put any bill that is in a dispute for collection, and if they do, the collection agency HAS TO ACCEPT A WRITTEN DISPUTE of a validity of a debt before reporting any debt to the credit agency and verify the validity of the debt. 
As of today, I still didn't receive any response from XXXX XXXX XXXX. It seems that I, as the patient, have no right to know why the doctor that I never chose ALEGGEDLY appeared for in-patient visits every 3-4 days and what he ALLEGEDLY did every 3-4 days. I AM STILL AWAITING THE EXPLANATION AND THE ANSWERS to my questions asked on XX/XX/2018. 
Based on the phone call with the representative of XXXX on XX/XX/2018, it's allegedly the PlusFour 's policy to refuse the certified mail correspondence received from people. Under Nevada law, I have a right to dispute the validity of a debt in WRITING within 30 days of receiving a collection notice. I made a WRITTEN DISPUTE OF A VALIDITY OF A DEBT, but PlusFour ignored it by its refusal to accept certified mail. In my opinion, by implementing its non-acceptance of certified mail policy, PlusFour doesn't want people to dispute a validity of a debt, and PlusFour doesnt want to go through a hassle of obtaining a verification of a debt for a consumer. 
I never in my life dealt either with a doctor that IGNORES the requirement of the pre-certification of non-emergency visits or with a collection agency ( or anyone ) that REFUSES to accept a certified mail letter. 
In my current experience, PlusFour HIDES from people behind its non-acceptance of certified mail policy, and XXXX  XXXX XXXX  ( doctors ) CONCEAL from PlusFour receiving the payment of {$680.00} from my insurance, as well as the fact there was the {$1500.00} adjustment to charges, and doctor 's irresponsiveness to my request for the explanation of his 17 non-emergency visits and to my request for the copy of medical notes/records/results, etc.. And I, as the consumer, am left to deal with the credit bureau agency that doesn't care about the proper investigation of the dispute as well.",Debt collection

"I recently refinanced my home and the loan was sold to BSI Financial who it looks like you have recently investigated for similar issues.

I am happy to provide the statements and proof of payments but if you look at them it is clear as day that they have added an additional payment as the XXXX statement showed I owed my regular payment due XXXX and showed that I was delinquent for the XXXX payment which I paid on XX/XX/XXXX. 


It's as clear as day and all you need to do is look at the 4 statements and you can see this is a mistake on their end. However, I have now called them 4 times trying to get them to resolve this issue and have even escalated to a manager but I am not getting anywhere with them. I have emailed them proof of payments twice now but they keep stringing me along telling me they will look into it and have now reported a 30 day delinquency on my credit report! My credit score is over 800 and I have never had a 30 day late reported against me ever. The fact that this is so completely obvious leads me to believe they might actual be trying to scam me. 


I did some digging and noticed that you recently settled with them for similar issues, they have 80+ XXXX XXXX XXXX complaints, a pending class action, and pretty much 1 star on most review sites. In reading through other peoples comments it looks like they have had the same issue where they string you along until you show as 60 days delinquent and then try to repossess and sell your house out from under you. 


I should mention I also received a letter from them saying that they don't show me as having insurance and if I didn't send them a copy of the statement right away that they would purchase insurance for me at a "" substantial '' cost. This is weird because the loan was just transferred to them and I contacted the initial agent who confirmed they had for sure set everything up correctly and it was all part of escrow. It sounds like this is another scam they run as many of the complaints against them tell the same story where they claim they didn't receive proof of insurance and then end up buying insurance for you and charging you a ridiculous amount and will not refund you even after showing proof. 


I'm not quite sure who to turn to at this point because I don't want them to try and sell my house out from under me which has over XXXX in equity. I'm wondering if I should just bite the bullet and pay that extra payment and late fees while I continue to fight them but wanted to see if you might be able to help since it sounds like you are already familiar with their shady lending practices.

SEARS ACCOUNT # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX In XXXX XXXX I approved a settlement for Sears # XXXX for {$5200.00} XXXX Balance was {$10000.00} ) however the funds were paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX not XXXX XXXX XXXX who was handling the collection the balance they reflect is {$11000.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX to inquire why my Sears account was showing up in my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) account status as Upcoming-Account not Ready whereas this account was settled on XX/XX/XXXX. 

XXXX escalated the discrepancy but suggested I obtain a paid in full letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attempted to reach out XXXX  continuously the line was always a continue busy signal and XXXX could not provide any other number nor could I find one. 

XXXX XXXX I was notified via mail from Freedom Debt the {$5200.00} was deposited back to my XXXX dedicated account due to a Data Breech caused by a XXXX employee and a third party. 

XX/XX/XXXX I applied to refinance my XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX XXXX only to find out the Sears Account was reflected on my credit report as charge off with a balance of {$11000.00} this caused me to not be able to move forward with the refinance until I am able to have the charge off reflect {$0.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX assisted me to again escalate the Sears account it was turned over to XXXX XXXX XXXX to resolve on my behalf. 

XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I were required to e-sign a POA for XXXX XXXX XXXX to act on our behalf to address the Sears open account issue. I was contacted by XXXX XXXX XXXX who advised me that XXXX XXXX XXXX advised XXXX XXXX that Sears was no longer collecting on the account as it was too old and it was charged off XX/XX/XXXX which is 14 months after the date I approved the settlement on Sears # XXXX which was paid to XXXX  fraudulently. My concern was does the Sears account now come off my credit report and I was advised I should wait 30- 90 days for it to come off the report and if not call Sears directly. 

I checked my credit report on XX/XX/XXXX only to find out Sears Acct XXXX was still reflected as charge off with the balance of {$11000.00}. When I contacted Sears XXXX I was advised the account was too old to collect on it was charged off XX/XX/XXXX and just because it was charged off doesnt mean they will report it as a XXXX  balance unless its paid. I explained as far as I knew in XX/XX/XXXX it was settled and explained the entire fraud issue. All she could advise was if I wanted a XXXX  balance to be reflected I had to pay it. Two addresses to send payment Citi Bank  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Az XXXX Attn : Payment Dept. Or over night Citi Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, KY XXXX Reference my name ; last 4 of SS # and Acct # XXXX. She advised there could be no negotiation for a lower amount it exceeded the statue of limitation and even if I did not have XXXX remove this account from my program they would not be able to negotiate because it exceeded the Statue of Limitation. 

So because this account was part of a data breech this caused the Sears Account to no longer be able to be negotiated and XXXX never acted further on the account to resolve it even though it was part of the data breech all they did was deposit the amount of the funds they paid out to XXXX back into my XXXX dedicated account. 

The amount of {$5200.00} that was deposited into my XXXX account is still in the account I did not take the funds back. It is imperative I get this matter resolved so I can clear this discrepancy from my credit profile and be able to move forward with a refinance as was my initial intention until I learned about this issue. 

Please advise if you can assist me with this issue. I feel the "" free '' legal counsel XXXX provided to handle this discrepancy did not act favorably on my behalf whereas they simply advised Sears stated they would not longer collect on the account it was too old and XXXX "" free '' legal counsel advised me to authorize this account to be removed from my program and did not confirm the "" charge off '' would be reflected with a XXXX balance on my credit profile just simply advised I had to wait for it to be amended on my report 30-90 days.

"Target XXXX XXXX refuses to tell me when the account 's available credit line will reflect a large payment I made to my Target store credit card account. 

I paid {$1400.00} to my Target store credit card on XX/XX/2021 via an ACH debit to my bank account using their online payment service. The payment posted timely and reduced my outstanding balance. However, the payment did not increase the account 's available credit at the time it was posted. I understand that large payments are not always made available immediately but I want to know when the payment will be made available. 

After nine calendar days the card 's available credit still was not increased, so I sent a secure message requesting the date on which that would occur. They responded that payments are sometimes held and offered to schedule a conference call with my bank to confirm the ACH has settled. I replied, informing them that they did not answer my question and clarified the information I was looking for. In their reply, Target XXXX XXXX repeated that they sometimes hold payments, stated they are allowed by regulation to hold payments, were in the final stages of confirming the payment, and informed me the only way to make the credit line available was to schedule a conference call with my bank. They still did not answer my question. 

To be clear, I am not complaining about the length of time Target has held the payment ( although it is on the long side of being reasonable ).

To fix this, i faxed my drivers license along with my social security number, birthdate, name and address with a request to correct my access the site, myequifax.com. they had me successfully change my password but still could still not get in online. The next day i was advised that even though i've been identified ( i finally was able to get thru to someone on the phone and they were able to identify me, unfreeze my account and request a copy of my credit report be sent to me ) they could not fix my online access unless i again submitted all my previous sent information BUT in addition I HAD TO ADD/SEND A COPY OF MY SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. I was told that if if didn't send in a copy of my social security card then i would not be able to get access to myequifax.com. I asked if any other document would suffice in addition to my driver 's license and was told, no, i had to specifically send in a copy of my social security card. 
I feel it is unreasonalbe ( not to mention a personal security exposure XXXX to be forced to send them a copy of my social security card to gain online access to Equifax. Especially, since thisis the primary means the public has to maintain and view their Equifax information. 
I am hoping your department can do something to have Equifax improve its methods of confirming idenitication ; they ask plenty of questions ( repeatedly ) and have this information on file already.

Equifax is VERY difficult to work with and nees to improve their processes. Their staff is process bound and simply follow scripts with no interest or desire to understand and fix situations beyond what the script calls for. 
Their response to this will probably be telling me their process is to require the social security card and i have to send it in along with sending the drivers license again, with no attempt to resolve what i consider an unreasonable and unfair requirement.they need to fix their process/procedures. 
I am hoping there is someone there that can help me re-gain my access to myequifax.com site.

"This is in regards to the major information breach and Equifax. 

Equifax indicated that my personal information ( all personal information they had, which is nearly everything as far as I know ) was breached and leaked. Reports indicate that Equifax woefully mismanaged their information security as well as their response to this breach of the personal information of 140 million Americans. 

I do not believe that Equifax has responsibly handled their duties to protect consumer information. 

As such, myself and many, many millions of others are now at constant risk of identity theft and fraud for the rest of our lives. This is deeply unfair and unjust - and Equifax now wishes to charge fees for their 'services ' to protect us from fraud, giving them more personal information to handle. Put very simply, this is extortion. Equifax put our information at risk and now offers to extort the public for 'protection. ' As of today, there is precious little the consumers affect can do aside from placing temporary fraud alerts. These only last 90 days - which is hardly solace now that we face a lifetime risk of fraud and identity theft. As of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I 've place 90 day alerts with two credit report bureaus, and am in the process of placing one with the third. 

Equifax needs to either compensate every single affected consumer for time and resources spent protecting ourselves from the risk they 've exposed us to. To resolve the issue, Equifax must work with other credit bureaus and federal agencies to fully reset the way credit is checked in our country. As of this breach, credit reporting is essentially WORTHLESS, as more than half of all consumers info is now potentially incorrect, unreliable, or stolen. The system needs to be reformed and consumers compensated.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

I have my own separate bank accounts. He had his. 

However, Mr. XXXX passed away at home on XX/XX/XXXX. It was a great shock to me and has saddened me tremendously It was at this time that I started to get my own mail and making arrangements to get assistance from friends and family.

"1 ) I recently submitted a Notice of Error under RESPA to my mortgage servicer, Financial Freedom, a division of CIT Bank. In response to my Notice of Error, my mortgage servicer indicated that there was no error. According to RESPA 12 CFR 1024.35 ( e ), "" If the servicer determines after a reasonable investigation that no error occurred [ t ] he servicer must state that it determined that no error occurred, the reasons for its determination, and the borrower 's right to request documents relied upon by the servicer in reaching its determination and how the borrower can make such a request, "" In the servicer 's response, they did not include a statement of my right to request documents relied upon by the servicer in reaching its determination and how I can make such a request as required by 12 CFR 1024.35 ( e ). Thus, because of Financial Freedom 's omission, I have no way to know how to request those documents as is my right under federal law. 

2 ) Furthermore, RESPA 12 CFR 1024.35 ( e ) also states that the servicer "" provide contact information, including phone number, for further assistance. '' I informed Financial Freedom of the aforementioned issue via the contact email that they included in their response for further assistance. I informed them that because of their omission, I did not know how to request those documents. In the email itself, I informed them that if their email was the appropriate vehicle to request those documents that they should take my email as an official request. They have remained completely and utterly unresponsive and have not provided further assistance as is their obligation under federal law. 

3 ) I also recently submitted a Request for Information under RESPA to Financial Freedom. In response to my Request for Information, they did not fully comply with my request. They listed exceptions that might allow them not to comply with my request for information as follows : "" Your letter also appears to be presented as a Qualified Written Reqeust ( QWR ) pursuant to RESPA. Please note that federal courts have determined that demanding a laundry list of information or making overbroad requests for documents does not constitute a QWR under RESPA, nor do demands for documents relating to the origination of a loan or challenging the validity of loan documents. { See XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) ( requests seeking documents to "" audit '' a loan or challenging the validity of the loan are not QWRs ; also note that requests using almost identical information to the requests in your document, did not provide sufficient information for servicer ) ; XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) ( demand for a "" laundry list of information '' ) was not a QWR, requests were not related to the servicing of the loan, but rather more generally to the allegations of predatory schemes in the mortgage industry ; overbroad categories of information ( e.g., complete life of loan history, etc ) did not assist the bank in identifying what to investigate and was not a proper QWR ]. '' According to RESPA 12 CFR 1024.36 ( f ), "" [ i ] f a servicer determines that any of these five exceptions apply, it must provide written notice to the borrower within five days ... after making that determination, including the basis relied on. '' In Financial Freedom 's response, they list several possible exceptions to their obligation to comply with my request, but they never explicitly state which exception applied to my specific request, nor did they indicate the basis for their determination as required by 12 CFR 1024.36 ( f ). 

Unfortunately, it appears that because I submitted the Notice of Error and Request for Information by myself and not through a lawyer, Financial Freedom believes that they can take advantage of me and deny me certain rights under federal law under the guise of being compliant.",Mortgage

"I have been paying off my loans based on the income based repayment ( IBR ) plan for more than 10 years. My loan servicer has been changed 4 times prior to being transferred finally to MyFedLoan as per my request in XX/XX/XXXX. Previously, all servicers were changed without my approval/request nor warning. My previous loan servicers are as follows : XXXX XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XXXXXX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX ; XXXX XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I have records of all previous servicers from XXXX and the amount paid during the times with each, but not the specific bills my new servicer ( MyFedLoan ) references in their counts of my loans. 

Recently, I requested transfer of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX, as I was coming up on the necessary 120 payments for the public service loan forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. It took approximately 6 months for this request to be completed and in XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred. Upon transfer to MyFedLoan, I realized many loan payments were missing, labeled ineligible due to you do not have a bill due for this payment period ( previously stated no bill ) and/or not reviewed at all. I should note, I did in fact receive bills monthly for all of these payment labeled you do not have a bill due for this payment period, as I would not have made payments otherwise. I was never on an automatic payment plan. I also complied with the yearly income recertification information with all servicers. 

I have called MyFedLoan numerous times since XX/XX/XXXX, and each time have been given different information by the agent or different suggestions on which actions I should take next to rectify this issue/clarify the issue. Many agents can not even clarify what "" no bill '' or you do not have a bill due for this payment period actually means or why payments are ineligible.

Now, according to the last 3 agents, I am under treasurer review and they are unable to fully comment on my account. The last agent suggested I upload any information from my previous servicers, which I completed. One even suggested I upload 10 years of bank statements to prove payment, which I will happily do if this would truly help. I uploaded the manual count I requested from XXXX prior to the transfer of my loans in XX/XX/XXXX, which shows I have completed 117 payments as of XX/XX/XXXX. Initially I was told a treasurer review would be quick since I was technically close to the 120 payments, yet the last agent I spoke to stated this could take 6-12 months to be completed. 

In addition to this, agents have told me I have many periods of forbearance listed on my account. A few of these I understand are from when my servicer was switched but many are not and were not approved or requested by me either. 

As I continue to check my account, I have now seen some previous payments which were listed as eligible are now not, without explanation or notification. I have also received concerning information from the last agent I spoke to asking if I "" wanted to set up an online account '' which I already have had for months. When asked what he meant, he stated it was likely a "" computer issue '' that he could not see my account and not to worry about my information being mishandled. 

At this point I do not know when my treasurer review will be completed and/or what that all entails. Communication of changes has been poor. Explanations of my account when I ask specific questions are met with uncertainty or different explanations by different agents. One agent stated he knows the process is confusing and at times is even confused himself - how can I possibly be sure I am receiving correct information if an agent says this to me, or be reassured that my account is accurately being handled correctly. This process is becoming frustrating and infuriating as I have completed all necessary payments and steps for this program, which was originally developed to help those who work for non-profit agencies in order to help with loan repayment.",Student loan

The reason I fell behind with the note, my ex husband was ordered to pay six mortgage payments last year to bring the mortgage current but he never followed the judge orders during our divorce. 
Currently, the mortgage is in default held by the holder XX/XX/XXXX. I was told by Dovenmuehle Mortgage I have 37 days fromXX/XX/XXXX to pay the default in the amount of {$7900.00} to satisfy the account or foreclosure procedures will take place.

The process was completed and my old loan was paid off.The new loan paid for my past due balance for XX/XX/XXXX, the old loan and the closing fees which brought the principal from {$130000.00} from {$130000.00}. I received a paid in full letter as well as a statement advising me that my next payment was not due until XX/XX/2016. A week or so later, XXXX XXXX me to request my husband 's signature because according to him, if you'r married in Kansas, your husband 's signature is required in order to register the deed. At the time my husband was living in XXXX where I could only send him the paperwork via email and he would sign, notarize and scan them to an email and send them back to me to give to Pacific Union Financial , LLC. But unfortunately, they demanded that he goes to the U.S embassy in XXXX to have the paperwork notarized and sign which delay the time they would have received the signed documents back from him because he had to wait for over a week before he would be able to meet with a consular officer to notarize and sign the papers. When he finally made it the the embassy, he was informed that each page that the consular officer had to notarize would cost {$50.00} U.S. The whole thing ended up costing {$250.00} U.S because there were XXXX pages which needed signature and notary. After my husband went through XXXX to get the paperwork back to me, when I sent them to the title company, I never got a reply from XXXX ( a representative from XXXX ). I contacted XXXX to inform her of the email I sent with the requested signature. That 's when she asked me to contact my loan officer. When I contacted XXXX XXXX, he told me oh by the way the fund that paid off the old loan was taken back because the paperwork was not received by the title company in a timely manner. I later received a statement requiring me to pay for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, as well as the regular XX/XX/XXXX payment. when I explained to him that I could n't get them the paperwork any sooner because XXXX is not a very structured country, everything takes a long time, especially legal documents. He told me there was nothing he could do. I asked him why he did not tell me from the very beginning of the refinance process that my husband 's signature would be needed on the paperwork, and why he waited until the title company caught up with the discrepancy to ask for the required signature, he simply said he did n't think they would need it since he lives in XXXX. Now instead of getting a break to catch up on my past due balance, I now have an even bigger mess to clean, because XXXX told me that I would be receiving over {$2000.00} from my escrow, so the money I had to pay for XXXX was spent on other circumstances that arise in my life, including paying for my husband 's medical exam for immigration process to come to the United States, as well as purchasing a plane ticket for him to come here once his visa was granted. The same XXXX XXXX who failed to properly inform me regarding the refinance process is the same one who started screening my calls and reject my calls every time I called to ask that the fund be put back. When he finally answered my call, he was really rude and as I tried telling him that he 's the reason why I 'm in this mess now, his answer was you should have paid your mortgage on time, do n't you blame me for your failure to pay your mortgage. I asked to talk to his supervisor XXXX XXXX to inform him about what happened, he was even more arrogant. So was XXXX 's supervisor XXXX XXXX. Now I have XXXX loans with PUF",Mortgage
"In XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, I filed Bankruptcy chapter XXXX to avoid a foreclosure after 19 months of payments until XX/XX/XXXX. After that my loan got transferred from XXXX XXXX to Rushmore on XX/XX/XXXX, but Rushmore started treating my account as Bank Owned instead as an account under Bankruptcy Chapter XXXX and they served my tenants a letter stating I was no longer the owner of my property. Since then i have not been able to collect any rent payments from my tenants ( see attached exhibit A ). 
I got a letter from Rushmore on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the process to rescind the foreclosure has been completed and that the account is no longer in Real Estate Owned ( REO ) or eviction status. ( see attached exhibit B ) but it wasn't true Now on XX/XX/XXXX has been more than 1year and half and Rushmore still has not rescind the title back to me!! I have been continuing to make my plan payments thru bankruptcy until now. 

I am requesting to help me to resolve this matter, unfortunately due to this situation i have not been collecting rent since XX/XX/XXXX. My tenants have refused to pay me since tenants told me i am not the current owner! 

See attached current title with shows Trustee 's Deed Upon Sale only ( exhibit C ) Right now Rushmore offer me a loan modification with the following terms "" AFTER ALL TRIAL PERIOD PAYMENTS ARE TIMELY MADE AND YOU HAVE SUBMITTED ALL THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTS "". This modification is telling me that i need to qualify and i don't think its fair. And also Rushmore wants me to start making payments on XX/XX/XXXX, and they want me to be in charge to do the eviction process which I don't know how many months it will take to vacate the property and due to COVID-19 we have to wait until XX/XX/XXXX. Without knowing if the tenants will move out by that time. 

I don't think it is fair for me when the lender made all this mistake. 

I am requesting to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to stay involve in this problem until Rushmore Rescinds back the property.

"Hello there, Few days ago I found a collection notice in my credit history while checking XXXX app and become very surprised because I always pay my bills. Same day I visited company ( XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA - XXXX  ) associated with the record and paid everything in full : {$230.00} reported as bad debt. I asked to recall the claim and remove this record because I was never informed that I owe something to this company, however they told me that they cant do that. 

So, here I am looking for an advice and there is a full story below. 

First of all, I always pay my balance at the front desk right after appointment if asked and never had payment issues. 

My kids had been receiving treatment in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX CA from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. 

They havent received dental care from XXXX XXXX XXXX as we changed dental clinic since XX/XX/XXXX. 

Also, on XX/XX/XXXX we moved to new house and so our mailing address has been changed. 

Full forward to XX/XX/XXXX : I was checking my XXXX account and found that I have {$230.00} debt collection from XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXn on my account since XX/XX/XXXX. 

I visited this dentistry and paid my balance in full same day. Then, I called them and they connect me with the account manager who told me that they tried to notify me by mail and made several attempts to call me. I asked to recall claim because in fact I was never informed even about existence of the balance/debt, but they declined. 

I double-checked up my voicemail records since XX/XX/XXXX and found only three voicemails from XXXX XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX that says that theyre canceling my kids appointment due to California guidelines ( Covid related ), on XX/XX/XXXX asking to call them back, and XX/XX/XXXX account manager called me and asked to call them back in my best convenience. I am getting tons of such calls and consider them as a spam, so I did with these because they did not provided me with any information about pending balance or payment issues. 

Simply speaking, I didnt receive any letters, phone calls or emails informing about my medical debt from the clinic. 
I understand they might be sending mails to my old address, but even with turned on mail forwarding feature I did not receive any correspondence. 
However, they had my cell phone and email which could be used to inform me. Which they did not, while claiming that they did. 

My question, should this be considered as unfair practice and a reason to remove my collection record from the credit history?",Debt collection

After multiple calls and escalation to WF, WF indicated that they will send the record that they fulfilled the stop payment order and return of funds but that record has never been received. 

I had to make an extra mortgage payment to ensure that my account stays current, I may have also incurred additional fees from a late payment and extra interest because the "" additional '' payment was received late.

"My auto loan with Navy Federal Credit Union ( NFCU ) was opened on XX/XX/2018. 
Upon review of my credit report I discovered that NFCU was reporting my loan as being paid 30 days late around XXXX 2018. 
I receive SSDI and am paid direct deposit into NFCU no later than the XXXX and every month call them personally so that I can access my pending deposit into my account a day early. They require that any payments owed to them such as my monthly mortgage payment and auto loan be paid in full and made current to do so. At that time, I authorize NFCU to pay those accounts by the representative I am talking to and then I can access my account. 
Despite a lawsuit against NFCU, they continue to limit access to my account when I am overdrawn or a payment is past due. I am redirected to what they call my delinquent account page which is a white screen and limited access to view my accounts. Every single month its the same thing despite being able to look at my account to understand I am paid once a month and have always brought my accounts current. 
I contacted NFCU several times regarding this late payment and am told that I have access to the exact same information they behave and XXXX 2018 is too old to access certain details. I was request to speak with an account rep was denied on my last call. While reviewing my account information I discovered transactions that were confusing in addition to a late fee that is assessed every month and added to my auto loan balance despite that loan being paid usually within what is commonly known as a grace period although it is difficult to find such information on their website. 
At no time over the course of 1 year was I ever informed of a 30 day late payment although I did have that loan adjusted at some point to a lower interest rate and payment because of financial hardship and having excessive medical bills and issues with my spouses health. Currently my account status on my auto loan is current and I have not made a double payment to account for any payments not being made because I would know given my limited XXXX income. If there was a mistake in making the payment then the burden is with NFCU because they are the ones handling the account and the payments at the same time my pending funds are released.

They did not have my permission to have any access to my personal information and the access they have does not bring any value to me as consumer. I have material evidence that shows where they violated the federal law and used misleading tactics to attempt to deceive me into paying this alleged debt. The communication I received from Halsted Financial Services violates 15 USC 1692c and is highly inconvenient to my peace of mind and privacy to my abode and place work. Halsted Financial Services also violated 15 USC 1692b ( 2 ) stating to me the consumer by mail that they are attempting to collect debt several times in the postcard. The postcard that was sent to my address by Halsted Financial Services was also in violation of 15 USC 1692b ( 4 ). Halsted Financial Services used a branded logo on the postcard that was sent in the mail to my address that indicated they were in fact in the debt collection business which violates 15 USC 1692b ( 5 ). The language that was used in the postcard sent from Halsted Financial Services was obscene and profane and did not bring any value to me the consumer, and the language used in the contents threatens to harm my reputation which violates 15 USC 1692 ( d ) ( 1 ) and 15 USC 1692d ( 2 ). Halsted Financial Services posted discounted advertisements in the contents of the postcard to coerce me into paying the alleged debt which violates 15 USC 1692d ( 4 ). Halsted Financial Services showed a positive balance in the contents of the postcard that was allegedly owed on. I am not sure how or why anyone would pay on a positive balance. Therefore the debt collector is in violation of 15 USC 1692e ( a ) and 15 USC 1692e ( 10 ).

"I leased a XXXX  XXXX XXXX for 36 months with American Honda Finance. I made every monthly payment on time, never missed. When turning in the vehicle at the end of the lease I was unknowingly charged a vehicle lease return fee of {$240.00}. 
The vehicle lease return fee was never brought up to me while getting the vehicle with the agent at the dealership. The fee is mentioned in the very very small fine print on the lease agreement. It is barely readable. 
After returning the car we moved from XXXX FL to XXXX FL due to being affected by hurricane Irma. I did not receive any mail from Honda Finance regarding the charge, nor was I aware of any fee assessed. 
Couple of months later I notice my credit report has a charge off from American Honda Finance. They are still marking my account 30 days late. 
I called American Honda Finance to ask them to waive the lease return fee, due to the fact that we made every single monthly payment on time for the amount of the lease payments, and the fee was never brought up at the dealership, it was only mentioned in the very small fine print of the lease agreement. They declined. 
I am writing this dispute to ask that the {$240.00} lease return fee be waived, all late payment marks be removed, the charge off be removed, and the status updated to paid as agreed. 
The return fee is very unnecessary, and misleading which is why they practically have to hide it in the small fine print of the agreement. It has blemished my otherwise perfect credit report, and it is not an accurate indication of how I pay my bills. I am asking the bureau to assist us and monitor the resolution in this matter.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

I ask rep if there is any way to reverse the decision, and she tells me it is possible. Says she would put in a request for the investigator, the original representative from XXXX, to call me back and run through the situation again, and that he should call within 2 business days. I ask if there is anything I could do to help my case. She tells me that in the claim 's notes, it was written that I did not file a police report, and that I should. I WAS NEVER ASKED IF I FILED A POLICE REPORT during that phone call, nor ever advised that I should from the original rep. I realized then that my claim may have already been mishandled by that original representative. 

XX/XX/2021 I call Wells Fargo again, since I never received a call. I am in the process of filing a police report at this point and ask for information about the transfer, such as the recipient 's real name, their bank name, locations, etc., as this is some of what the report asks for. This rep tells me they have no information regarding the transfer. I ask how they have no information, and she tells me their notes only provide details from calls. I realize then that the original rep came up with his resolution with no actual information regarding the transfer. This rep tells me she can put in a request for the investigator to call me back in 2 business days, yet again. I tell her I had already put in a request and was not called back, which was the reason I called that day. She tells me the "" notes '' say I was called on XXXX, and I supposedly hung up. I received zero calls before or after I called on XXXX. No calls show up in my phone history, and no voicemail, email, any type of notification was left whatsoever. The rep from XXXX also never mentioned me having been called, so I feel this statement was falsified. Regardless, I still never received a call between my XXXX and XXXX calls. This representative proceeds to put in another request for a call-back. I ask her if I should be receiving the call from the same fraud department number, or if it would be from a different Wells Fargo number. She responds that it would be from the fraud department. 

XX/XX/2021 I get a call from a representative, who was not the original investigator, from a random number from North Carolina. At this point already, I see that Wells Fargo representatives do not even have cohesive answers to my questions, since I was told the day before that I would be called from the fraud department, and I was not. This phone call was just to give me some information about the transfer, like I had asked the day before. I realize then that I was only called because they now had a note that said I was filing a police report, not because I wanted to run through the situation of my claim again. I ask this rep if again, there are any chances I could still get my money back. She tells me Wells Fargo gets XXXX attempts to reverse the transfer, and they have only tried once so far. The original representative denied and closed my case after ONE ATTEMPT. If I had not told these reps that I was filing a police report, this information would not have been relayed to me, and I truly believe the last two attempts would not be made. The representative tells me to just "" keep a look out '' to see if the money would appear back in my account; did not say I would be notified of any changes or anything. These Wells Fargo representatives do the least for their customers and leave them in the dust when they need help most. 
I received a letter later that day, denying my claim as I was told stating, "" As the money will not be returned from the receiving bank, we are not able to reimburse you. '' This "" investigator '' denied and closed my claim with the reasoning of "" the money will not be returned from the receiving bank '' after having only tried ONCE out of their three attempts to reverse the transfer. This letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX, but was not sent until XXXX, and I did not receive it until the XXXX ( picture attached. ) There is absolutely no sense of urgency by these bankers about something so time-sensitive and as crucial as this situation. I followed the policy instructions of notifying the bank of situations like this, and they still did the very bare-minimum. There is a complete lack of communication from them with their customers, unless they are made aware that an official report, like my police report, is being filed. 
I have turned in my police report at this point ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and have made a security freeze to my credit file as well, which I also had to find out about on my own, when I wish I had been informed about by the very company I trusted to handle my money. I have no income and have had almost no money for nearly three weeks because I have been getting the run-around by these bankers, and they have completely failed me by not fully attempting to help me get my money back. And there still leaves the question of how this "" fraudster banker '' was able to identify that I was a Wells Fargo customer and retrieved my name and contact information, called from a Wells Fargo number, and sent SMS messages from Wells Fargo, if not for a security breech in the Wells Fargo system.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

According to the customer service rep, that was because they were adding the {$410.00} and the {$100.00} that I paid ONCE, and used that as my old escrow amount. When I pointed out the error I got a laugh. 
I don't find the errors in my escrow account funny. This is not the first time a bank has not been able to add correctly for escrow. Seems to be an industry thing that they steal from people who are unaware that banks can't add.",Mortgage

"Equifax XXXX up my credit profile and showed bad attitude on assisting me solving the problem. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied XXXX XXXX Credit Card from XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX pulled my credit report from Equifax, then denied my application given the reason of "" too many ( XXXX ) accounts opened within last 24 months ''. I then telephoned XXXX customer support and found out that the credit history XXXX got from Equifax was not accurate at all. In the report provided by Equifax to XXXX, I found there are several accounts that were not opened by me. Then I telephoned Equifax customer service and requested a dispute of those accounts against my Credit profile. 
I was offended by the process of how Equifax handled my dispute request. Here are my primary complaints : 1. Dereliction of duty Equifax required me to submit a lot of supporting documents ( W-2, pay-stub, SSN Card, Drivers License, Address, Rental Agreement, Utility Bill, etc ) to validate my identity, which in my opinion exposed their failure to protect users ' credit info but to return the responsibility to the user to prove his identity. 
2. Processing speed very slow Despite Equifax 's dereliction of duty, I still submitted those docs accordingly. However, it took Equifax nearly a month only to be able to verify my identity, not even mentioning investigating the inaccurate info requested in my dispute request against the credit report they provided. Interestingly, their call center representative told me this process only takes no more than a week in general. 
3. Unresponsive customer call center representatives During the processing time, I telephoned their call center quite a few times tracking the updates. However, none of them was useful. Every time what I can only hear was their emphasis on they couldn't see anything from their database, so I had to either wait or to re-submit again. They even suspected me mailing the docs to the wrong place. Ironically, the mailing address was provided by Equifax. I believe it was because of their internal miscommunications which caused the delay, however, what I felt about the attitude from the representative was "" We can't do anything from our Equifax side. If you want us to process the dispute, you have to provide this and this, that and that ... '', even forgetting the cause of this inconvenience may possibly be the recent data exposure to the hacker, in which Equifax was the one at fault, not us customers. 
4. Problem still unresolved Now I received their full credit report, but still notice lots of wrong information recorded on the report which are not relevant to me at all ( wrong former name, non-existing accounts opened by me, invalid credit inquiries, etc ). I proactively contacted the banks I don't think I have any accounts with, but was reported by Equifax, and got proof from them those accounts don't exist.

"This is following up on my previous claim which was closed. I now have proof that my ex husband has tried to remove me via an assumption ( per Navy Federal this is the only way to remove me ) and they WILL NOT LET HIM do this! 

In XX/XX/XXXX my husband and I got a divorce. Per speaking to a Navy Federal representative prior to our divorce we were told we needed to provide a divorce decree and quit claim deed removing me from the home and then I would be let off the mortgage. After we completed all of this and then submitted this paperwork I was informed that their rules had changed and I would not be allowed off the mortgage until my ex husband did a few other things. I am unable to get him to do any of those things as we were divorced at that point. I have contacted Navy Federal and disputed this being reported on my credit for years however it still remains. In XXXX my ex husband was permitted to extend the mortgage for an additional 10 years to a 40 year mortgage and add some personal debt to it. I did not sign this paperwork and his sister is the notary who notarized it. I disputed this again given that I do not know how this could have even been legal however have been turned down again. My ex husband does not pay the mortgage on time, does not live in the home and this is literally ruining my life. I can never get approved for anything and if I do it is at the cost of a ridiculous rate. I want this mortgage which was unethically and possibly even illegally extended and added to without my consent removed from my credit reporting","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

The mortgage company confirmed received all of receipts on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In the days after receipt of the paid in full receipts, the mortgage company has stated that they will not pay any funds unless they receive a letter from the insurance company stating that they hired the 3rd party. As of XX/XX/XXXX, they are stating that they will not reimburse us the borrower for out of pocket expenses until another estimate is done on the home which should have nothing to do with releasing our out of pocket funds. 

Every time we contact the mortgage company, there is some reason that they give us that was not given to us the day prior as to why they are not able to reimburse us from the checks that have been signed and sent to them for our "" escrow '' account. Each time we call, they say that "" special approval '' is needed from upper management to release our funds as it is not their standard procedure to release money without a contractor. Hiring a contractor should not have any baring on the mortgage company reimbursing us for money that has already been paid out of pocket by the borrower to protect the home from further damage ; we are not far enough in the process to even begin hiring a contractor and being to repair our home based on the financial strain that being out of pocket this amount of money for this long as put on us. Our out of pocket expenses were included in supplemental checks that were sent, separate from the original estimate check and the mortgage company is still refusing to send reimbursement for out of pocket expenses. 

When we have asked to speak to a supervisor, we are told that no one is available in the office and that we would have to request a call back and it would take 24-48 hours.

"1. XXXX XXXX XXXX incorrectly reported my wife and I as being late, failure to pay, and owing 3 payments when only 1 was possibly due. XXXX made the report due to the failure of the local dealership to report to XXXX that we had turned in our leased XXXX MKX under XXXX Red Carpet program and leased a new XXXX MKX at the same time. It was the dealer and XXXX responsibility to properly report that we had completed and complied with all terms and conditions of our lease on the XXXX. They did not. 
2. As a result of XXXX 's inappropriate and incorrect actions, all XXXX of the credit bureaus ( Experian, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX ) all immediately reported us as late and dropped our credit score anywhere from XXXX to XXXX points. ( Approximately XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) 3. Within a few days and after our complaint to XXXX and the dealership ( XXXX XXXX in XXXX ) they agreed with us and started trying to get the credit unions to correct their reports. After 2 weeks with no progress, I filed disputes with the agencies. ( Approximately XXXX XXXX to XXXX, XXXX ) 4. XXXX told me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX that they had done everything they could and we just had to wait on the agencies to make corrections. Experian told me on XXXX XXXX, XXXX that my dispute was resolved and the late payment was removed. I believe XXXX has made the correction also, but not XXXX XXXX. 
5. Here is the problem : All agencies immediately lowered our credit scores, but when the correction were made, they only raised our scores a portion of what they previously decreased them. Before the issue occurred, our scores ranged from XXXX to XXXX. They dropped to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX upon the late payment report. When they raised the scores it was significantly less than before all this happened. As an example, Experian dropped my score XXXX points but only raised it by XXXX points. 
6. This score calculation is not fair to us. It was not our fault that resulted in our scores dropping. Why did the scores not go back to where they were before the incorrect XXXX report? 
7. How does an individual dispute a score when the formula and math behind the calculation is cloaked in such secrecy? I absolutely know that the new scores were not fairly calculated ( or they would have gone back to the original scores ), but how can I prove this and get the credit agencies to correct our scores? 
8. Why is it that the credit agencies are so fast to report bad things and drop a persons score ( one day ), but it takes them 30 to 60 days to even begin to correct the error? They should be required to verify the correctness of these reports and be just as prompt in correcting errors as they are in reporting them in the first place. 
9. The agencies should be required to disclose the math and calculations behind the credit scores. Individuals can dispute incorrect information, but we have no way of disputing an incorrectly calculated credit score. If I am going to be held accountable for something, then I have to know what that something is. Stop signs are not hidden from view. They are open and available for all to see so that everyone can comply with the order to stop. In the case of credit scores, we have absolutely no specific information on which to base our behavior. Effectively, we are left to guess at the location of the stop sign.

"I applied and received a conventional loan from Mortgage 1 Incorporated dba XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in late 2015 for a Manufactured Home. This was a conventional loan and at the time was pleased with my experience. I am now in the process of selling this home and had made the decision to purchase a new home with the intent to sell the manufactured home. 

The issue I am now faced with is that according to HUD regulations I should not have received conventional lending for this home in 2015 due to the manufactured home having been moved to a secondary location. We were in the closing process with a buyer when their lender and title company brought this to our attention. I have talked to at least a dozen lending institutions, some of which specialize in Manufactured Home loans, and they all have said that I should not have been able to receive a conventional loan on this manufactured home. Due to this coming up during the week we were to close with the buyer they have decided to pull out of the offer. This is forcing us to put the manufactured home back on the market at a discount in the hopes of finding a cash only offer or someone who can qualify for a higher rate personal style loan for the home. If I am able to sell it at this discounted price I will have lost {$20000.00} between the first buyer and any potential buyer. 

Additionally, had I known we would have had re-sale issues we would not have made the decision to purchase a new home at this time or possibly never purchasing this Manufactured home in the first place.",Mortgage

I also pointed out to the representative that no where in Citi 's Card Member Agreement do they define a specific timeline for how long a client has to request a refund after an annual fee posts to their account.

They keep telling me that the tires are listed in the lease agreement, but I do not believe that replacing the tires with BETTER tires AND returning the original tires ( dismounted ) should make me obligated to pay for new tires. As a side not, I drove the vehicle 10K less miles than my lease agreement ( a total of about 32K ), and since half of each of those years I have the original tires on the vehicle, they clearly would NOT have been worn down. 

I have indicated to Chase that I will pay the incidental charges for scratches in paint and upholstery damage ( totaling about {$240.00} ), but I refuse to pay them for the tires.

From a period of time from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, encompassing 17 calls ( 9 of which were incoming from Quicken Loans ), and 11 emails, all communication was suggesting that my loan application had been properly vetted and was approved. An appraiser was even sent to my home and my home appraised for $ XXXX more than was necessary for the numbers to work. However, at the last minute, I was told that a portion of my household income ( recently acquired rental houses ) was not verifiable income because of less than 2 years viability ( showing on tax returns? ). Why didn't they say that at the very beginning? Not only was this whole process a hard pull on my credit, it was a colossal waste of time for me. 

I would think that the associates that routinely process applications for mortgage loans on a daily basis would be knowledgeable enough to know this before getting that deep in talks with a client or potential client. I have been in my home for almost 9 years and have not had a late payment on my mortgage. There were 2 loan scenarios that were presented to me ; one was a refinance with rate reduction only and the other was a cash out refinance. BOTH loans had a monthly payment that is less than what I currently pay. It seems terribly unfair to have been led astray with the guidance that I received during this process.

When i contacted the company by phone the rep could not give me an explanation of what the extra {$50.00} was for. Then he stated well there was an extra charge after we received the collection. I asked what was it for. & he still could not give me an explanation. I said can i have proof of that. HE said sure, I still have not received it as of today. I once again called the company asking to speak w/ the supervisor which is XXXX, I asked to for all documentation on file to be sent to my address. Which i only received a letter saying they are attempting collection on the debt, with no explanation of the charges. This account is ruining my credit. In a previous complaint filed w/ cfpb the collector stated that the collection was for breach of contract of a lease agreement and would settle for {$600.00} but still did not explain the amount in detail of why there was a difference in the amounts that were listed in the requested validation of debt documents.

"I XXXX XXXX make a claim to each credit reporting agency ; i.e., XXXX, Trans Union and XXXX, as a subscriber to your companies to report adequately is in serious violation. As you can see, there are two bureaus showing XX/XX/XXXX as the first reported 30-day late payment, and XXXX showing XX/XX/XXXX. Realistically the late payments started in XX/XX/XXXX, but XXXX XXXX XXXX has cut off two years of payment history to re-age the credit trade line, which is a serious concern to the Federal Trade Commission. The charge of {$3400.00} was from an overage on mileage on a vehicle lease. The timeline to file a civil action has passed, and the federal guidelines, and the 7-year rule applies as the first reported late shows over the legal time limit. As stated in the Fair Credit Reporting Act : ( A ) In general, if after any reinvestigation under paragraph ( 1 ) of any information disputed by a consumer, an item of the information is found to be inaccurate or incomplete or can not be verified, the consumer reporting agency shall ( i ) promptly delete that item of information from the file of the consumer, or modify that item of information, as appropriate, based on the results of the reinvestigation ; and ( ii ) promptly notify the furnisher of that information that the information has been modified or deleted from the file of the consumer. [ Emphasis added. ] I desire an updated credit report showing a full reinvestigation of the account at the beginning of this credit dispute. I am well within my rights requesting this reinvestigation under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. I anticipate a full re-investigative credit report within 30 days. 
ITEMS MAY HAVE SURPASSED LEGAL TIMELINE TO MAINTAIN ON RECORD Case in point, if a credit card payment was late 84 months ago, and since that time the credit card was paid in full, settled for less than full balance, or charged off by a federally insured bank as mandated under Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Rule 5000,  applicability of applying a charge off standard to debt service, then the creditor must report the true payment history on the credit trade line for a minimum of 84-months. The Federal Trade Commission has levied fines and penalties against creditors for using a re-aging process totally in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act guidelines. 
Re-aging of debts have been used by the Internal Revenue Service by re-issuing federal tax liens with a new fining number when the 10-year rule timeline was running out. It is used by creditors as a means of stalling or delaying ones credit rating, simply by cutting off several years of previous payment histories. 
Accordingly, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is in violation to their subscriber agreement with each credit bureau and must delete the referenced account credit trade line permanently.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"My mortgage is with Wells Fargo. WFHM offered a forbearance on my loan due to COVID 19 that is supposed to be extendable in 3 month increments as needed for up to12 months under the CARES Act. The original period covered the XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 payments. The first 3 month extension covered XXXX, XXXX and XXXX payments. The current and 2nd 3 month extension would cover XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020. There is one addtiional 3 month period that can be requested that would cover XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020. 

LONG STORY SHORT : The forbearance extension is supposed to be readily available as an option, and does apply to this mortgage, which was verified in detail when the 1st extension was placed. Depsite over a dozen request over a 3+ week period, I still have not received correspondence verifying if the second 3 month extension is approved. No letters. No verification calls. No updates to the website ( which application link has been broken several times ).

Instead, I am treated to myriad of excuses and stall tactics such as : > you have to apply again > we need to do a review to make sure you are eligible > we need additional time to complete a review of options for your loan/investor > we are just overwhelmed by COVID and so many other BS time-stalling stress-causing excuses. I have made direct requests on line through the portal, sometimes
being directed to call in and sometimes not. I have spent countless hours on hold and dealing with WFHM staff who require that I repeat all of the information that I have submitted. I have escalated within the company, even having had multiple discussions with WFHM executive offices including phone bank members of the Executive Vice President, Despite all of these efforts, I am still no closer to finding out when the forbearance extension will be issued.

The correspondences I have received are all consistent with "" ask and you shall receive '' and/or repeat the same generic information that I still need to apply ( again which I have done so so many times  since mid XXXX ). 

TODAY is XX/XX/2020, which is 1/3 of through the month of XXXX, and I can't even get basic directives as to if and when the forbearance will be approved ... WHICH IS XXXX!! If I am to resume payments, which I would do if the fallout of COVID were not still ongoing and I could expect my income to recover, but that is not the case. It is not right that I am left hanging. It is not right that I am getting conflicting information. Etc.

WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN TO GET THIS RESOLVED??? WFHM needs to simply approve the extension AND make sure that the next round is drama free.

I stated that in XXXX, when my account was negatively impacted, BOA advised me to get a police report for the incident, but at the time, the police station stated that in order for me to file a report, I needed "" evidence '' of what happened and something showing who was actually involved. BOA had this information but refused to release anythign to me. So, at that time, I said "" forget it ''. BOA was to do a "" PROPER '' investigation in which they would have seen I was not responsible for anything negative regarding the account. BOA failed this investigation and just labled me as the "" accused '' because it was "" easier '' but not factual. 

The account actually closed because there was an "" electronic '' deposit that wasn't real. I had no way of doing this. How can I, a non-hacker without any hacker access, be able to ELECTRONICALLY deposit money that was never there? I have never been able to do this, and if you look at my banking history, it shows the same. 

BOA is now know to be the worse bank for the general consumer. They have screwed a lot of people 's files because of their lackadaisical internal processes that only helps the bank or their top dollar consumers. 

This just isn't fair, and I need advocacy. I'm starting here after failed attempts with BOA and XXXX. Then, I am writing the attorney general, and last, I will use my own attorney for a civil dispute.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"To Whom it may concern, I am writing regarding my ongoing dispute with the company Credit Acceptance Corp. My Credit Acceptance account number is XXXX. I purchased a car ( a XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX   XXXX XXXX, the price of the car was {$6000.00} ( attachment 1 ). I put {$2000.00} down, as the lender Credit Acceptance dictated. The dealership added a lender fee of {$450.00}, making the amount to be financed {$4500.00}. 
As the salesman was going over the sales contract with me ( attachment 2 ), he advised me that if I kept the loan for the full 48 months, I would pay a total amount of {$6800.00} and that it would be in my best interest to pay off this loan as soon as possible. 
On XXXX XXXX at XXXX, I called Credit Acceptance to obtain a payoff balance and was advised that amount was approximately {$6500.00}. I immediately advised the company that amount could not be correct. The company representative became belligerent and condescending. I advised the rep that I would like to file a dispute. The representative told me that he submitted my dispute and forwarded it to the complaint resolution department and that they would call me at a later date. 
I immediately called the auto dealership and spoke with the manager, XXXX. XXXX advised me that my figures were correct on the sale price of the car, and emailed me proof the cost ( attachment 1 ). XXXX was not able to provide a reason why the salesman entered the incorrect amount in the cash price box on the agreement that I did sign. XXXX also went to her accounting department and provided me with a copy of the payment from Credit Acceptance to XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  in the amount of {$4500.00} ( attachment 3 ). In addition, XXXX phoned Credited Acceptance to try to fix this error, but was told that I would be responsible for the amount entered into the cash price box of the contract AND further interest and fees on that amount. 
With an already excessively high interest rate of 28 %, paying that rate on an additional and incorrect {$4000.00} is obscene, abusive and predatory. I have paid my monthly payments on time, every month without postponing a single payment. See attached payment history ( attachment 4 ) which includes additional interest charged to me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from XXXX in the conflict resolution department of Credit Acceptance. During this 8 minute and 55 second call, she advised me to send in what documentation that I had to prove my dispute. I emailed my documents to her that evening and she returned my call the next day ( this call lasting 1 hour and 13 minutes ). XXXX said that based on the information that I submitted, there was a discrepancy but that they would not be making any changes to my account and the dispute was closed. During this call, I also spoke with supervisor XXXX, who also disregarded all of the documents that I submitted and advised that there would be no changes to my account. 
I have sent many emails and talked with XXXX  several times since then. I have not received a single written or email reply from this company. When I speak with XXXX on the phone, she hangs up and ends the conversation before all of my questions are answered. I have sent several email requests for the company to perform a real and actual investigation to no avail. I have asked for a written ( at least ) summary of their investigation and have been refused. 
During my phone calls with XXXX, I have been given deflective and deceptive answers to questions. For example, when I asked XXXX how many payments that I have made on my account, her answer was about 17, or maybe 20 to 25. When I asked her to add up the funds that I have sent in on all of my payments combined, her answer was well, if you financed {$8500.00} and your balance is now {$6500.00}, then you have paid in about {$2000.00}. When XXXX asked me if I had proof of what the car was selling for, I said yes, I have already sent this to you. Her reply was that is not a Credit acceptance contract, and then she promptly moved to another topic completely disregarding my answer AND the proof that she requested. 
I have made 17 payments for a total of {$4300.00} and been charged {$2300.00} in interest. All based on an incorrect sales price. I need to have my account recalculated with the correct sales price in place, and a financed amount of {$4500.00}. 
If I had a loan for {$4500.00} with an interest rate of 28 % and total payments of {$260.00} per month, the total payoff over the length of the loan should be {$5800.00}. However, for a loan on the amount of {$6800.00} the total payments for the life of the loan would be {$11000.00}. Credit Acceptance only paid {$4500.00} to the dealer for the car ( see attachment 3 ). They are requesting that I pay approximately {$5500.00} in invalid fees. 
All that I am asking for is what is fair, just and right. I would like an accurate balance on my account, so that I may pay off the car. I am not asking for a reduction in their abusive interest rate, nor even any sort of refund at this time, if my payments have over paid what I in actuality owe on this car. If, however, Credit Acceptance attempts to drag this dispute out and there is a large over payment on my part, I will ask to recoup that loss, with an interest rate of 28 %.

If Credit Acceptance insists that I pay on a loan of {$6800.00} with an interest rate of 28 %, and they only paid {$4500.00} to Incredible Auto, then I need them to make a payment to me in the amount of {$2300.00} plus 28 % interest for 16 months. This payment would insure that they would not be guilty of fraud.

I had been making payments then all of a sudden the loans were sold and I have no idea where they are. I was still paying through Navient but that is NOT who these funds were being dispersed to. 
Unfortunately a substantial amount of time has passed. I sent a previous complaint in XX/XX/XXXX stating that I could not reach anyone from XXXX XXXX now Navient. I was always routed to a collection agency, even though I have been paying on XXXX loan consistently since XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX responded admitting to this action taking place. The Case Number is XXXX. 
I was unable to contact anyone about where the loans were sold to. I received no correspondence. I even reached out to student aid.gov and they said that they can not help me as they do not handle these things but I can contact my lender. This was very unhelpful because a ) my loans had been sold b ) XXXX XXXX/Navient was routing all calls to creditors c ) you ca n't handle this issue but you can take my money. 
This has been a grueling process over the last 5 years and it 's a huge maze and circular. 
I have also recently found out that Navient has stooped applying my $ XXXX monthly payment to my {$1700.00} loan that I have been paying since XX/XX/XXXX. I am almost done paying it off and they have taken it upon themselves to appropriate the funds elsewhere without my permission. 
At this point this needs to be sent my state Senator and Attorney General.

What I would like to happen is for suntrust investigate the delays in keeping to there time lines and reimburst me for 2 month of PMI insurance as if they would have done all this in a timely manor I would have only paid for XXXX PMI insurance. If I would not called over 7 times to make sure this process was still moving forward I am confident that I would still be waiting for them to start this process.

"XX/XX/XXXX- My first phone call with them. I asked about lowering payments and they claimed the lowest they could go was {$980.00} a month so I asked for forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX- My second phone call with them. I again asked about lowering payments and they claimed they could not go any lower so I again asked for forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX- My third phone call with them. I asked again about lower monthly payments and the plan they gave we still could not afford so I again asked for forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX- They talked to my mom/ cosigner and myself and we gave them financial statements. In order for us to receive a lower payment plan. 
XX/XX/XXXX- They called my father/ cosigner looking for me even though I spoke to them the day before. I had not received any missed calls but my phone automatically blocked unknown numbers at the time so I called them back as soon as my dad told me. We tried to work out a lower payment plan. They took financial statements from me three separate times by three separate individuals. They took financial statements from my dad who is disabled twice and from my mother twice. They intimidated my dad and were incredibly rude to him to the point that he cried. He has XXXX XXXX and sometimes it takes him longer to process information and respond. They took advantage of this and bullied him. Then stated we didn't qualify for the reduced payment option because we couldn't prove that we could pay the reduce payment of {$500.00} either. They gave us three days to come up with something else that would make them feel "" comfortable '' giving us the reduced payment plan. Three days was not enough time. We looked into other options which is why I started writing letters via certified mail so I could have communication with them in writing. 

XX/XX/XXXX- I sent out my first letter via certified mail to them. Asking to cease phone communication and only communicate via letter from now on. I specifically asked them to not contact my co-signers, my co-signers place of work, or my place of work. 

XX/XX/XXXX- I sent out my second letter via certified mail asking for proof of debt validity. 

XX/XX/XXXX- My parents received a letter addressed to me at their house even though my return address was directly on the envelope of every letter I sent them. It was simply a change of address update not a response to either of my letters thus far. 

XX/XX/XXXX- I sent out my third letter via certified mail stating that I am willing to work with them and was waiting to hear back from them that they are willing to work with me. And to contact me via letter and only me about these loans. I specifically asked them not to contact relatives, siblings, and places of work of myself or my co-signers. 

XX/XX/XXXX- They called my uncle who has nothing to do with my loans. I am not even sure how they got his number. 

XX/XX/XXXX- Three letters to my mom XX/XX/XXXX- A letter to my mom XX/XX/XXXX- 5 letters to me, none a response to what I had written just general letters sent out to loans in threat of delinquency. 

XX/XX/XXXX - They sent a letter to me that just said "" thank you for your inquiry. We are committed to providing you with information and assistance you need. To address your concerns more efficiently, we ask that you call us at ___ '' I did not receive the letter until the XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX- I sent out my fourth letter via certified mail stating again that I was waiting to hear back them and offered a monthly payment which is something I can actually pay and still be able to have rent and food. 

XX/XX/XXXX- My uncle received a phone call looking for me. Although I had been sending letters since XXXX and explicitly asked multiple times to only be contacted via letter they continued to harass people who had absolutely nothing to do with my loans. I called them back and spoke to my account manager XXXX. We went over my finances and I told her what I could pay each month. She was very condescending and reminded me of the amount of my total loan and I reminded her that they gave a loan to an XXXX year old with no financial history with no guarantee I would be employed when I graduated. She repeatedly stated "" you asked for money and we gave it to you. '' Which is exactly my point. We had to conference in my mom/co-signer. The "" lowered '' payment plan they offered was {$670.00} a month something we still could not do and we tried to work with them to meet somewhere where we were both satisfied but neither XXXX nor her supervisor XXXX would budge. I am trying to pay my loans but I can not make money appear when I do not have it. I reminded them multiple times that I had been writing them letters and had only received one response to my address and they kept saying they could not send letters and could only talk on the phone but I know that is not true. I am willing to work with them but every time they talk on the phone they talk in circles and every time you say anything about lowering payments they transfer you to another person who is more rude than the last. If they truly wanted to work with people they would have other solutions.When I asked them why they called my dead grandfather, uncle, parent 's place of work, and ex co-workers they had no response. When I tried to ask them what they would be willing to do to work with me XXXX stated "" I am not going to negotiate with you. ' They said my offer of {$100.00} a month was too low. So I asked what about "" {$250.00} '' and they again XXXX stated he could not work with me. I reminded XXXX that if they want me to actually be able to make payments they needed to be willing to work with me. Neither he nor the company he works for were willing to work with me to resolve this matter. XXXX and XXXX continued to claim that this was the best they could do although in the forms I originally signed for the loans it mentions something called a Payment Holiday. Which would at least give me time to gather myself and see what else I could do to work with them. 

In the time between my first later and today my pare n't have been called almost daily. My significant other has received calls even though he is not on the loans and I never gave them his contact information or permission to speak to him about my account. My uncles have received calls. My grandma has received calls looking for my dead grandfather. My mom 's ex co-workers have received calls. My dad 's boss received calls. I have not been ignoring them, I have been writing them for months and waiting for written reply from them. Instead they waited to respond until the situation was very dire and harassed my family in an effort to intimidate and embarrass me into making agreements that I could not uphold.",Student loan

He also recommended after seeing our scores to proceed with an FHA option, as this would keep our closing costs lower and we were within the guidelines for approval of a fixed loan which was our preference. After discussing with my husband we removed him from the loan and proceeded with their recommendation to do the fixed rate FHA loan.

He emailed me back stating that the appraisal came back very good with a valuation of {$160000.00}, however the appraiser applied a condition that our front porch needed to be prepped, painted and paint chips removed, and be reinspected to meet FHA guidelines. I called XXXX and explained that this was a very big project as the porch stretches across the entire front of the house and we both work full time and that it may take a week or so to complete. He indicated that it was very important to complete the project ASAP. as a result of our conversation my husband cancelled his jobs for the day, and power washed prepped and painted the entire front porch completing it at XXXX on the same night we were informed that it needed to be done. He lost approximately {$790.00} in wages that day. We notified XXXX of the project completion the same day. We were told reinspection would cost {$170.00} and it would be added to our closing costs.

I requested an timeline from XXXX on resubmission to Underwriting with all conditions met, and was informed that the goal was to complete the entire process by our rate lock date of XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I felt like we were being very responsive and accommodating of their requests and anything that could be done to expedite things would be appreciated. I also informed him at that time that one of the loans that was orginally slated to be paid off by the refinance had already been succesfully paid off in the two months + that we had been working on this.

XXXX submitted everything back to underwriting on Wednesdy evening stating that there was a 24-72 hour turn around time on the approval. He also stated that he was going on vacation until the following Wednesday but had people helping his clients and that they would reach out. 
By Monday XX/XX/XXXX th I had not heard anything I attempted to reach out to those covering for XXXX with no response, so I called XXXX XXXX, our loan officer. He stated he would check on it and get back with me. He called me back and stated it had not yet been returned from underwriting and he would keep and eye on it as they expected it back at anytime. Tuesday still nothing back from underwriting according to all contacts. 
XXXX returned Wednesday and I called and inquired about the status of the underwriting. He called me later that day and said underwriting had not come back with an approval but rather more conditions that needed to be met. MUCH to my dismay as he listed the requested conditions, almost all of them had already been submitted previously. I voiced my concern that I felt like this was out of the ordinary and that I felt like I was not being treated fairly with the continuous delays and repeated requests for the same information. XXXX agreed and apologized, and stated that he would review with his manager and get an list emailed to me with what was needed. 
The following items were requested on 1. a signed and dated letter from my husband stating that he knew of the refi and had access to the accounts. ( this was previously sent ) _2. a signed and dated letter of explanation for derogatory credit information ( this was already sent twice ) 3. Provide verification of the following has been paid and released - state tax lien against XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$20000.00} plus costs and interest filed for record XX/XX/XXXX in book XXXX XXXX as case number XXXX XXXX county records. ( this was a tax lien that we were unaware of relating to sales tax debt from our business that we were on a payment plan for ) I resubmitted all prior letters that had already been sent prior and a copy of our installment agreement with the state. I also informed XXXX that we had no problem using the proceeds of loan to pay off the tax lien in full. I called and informed XXXX of the same. They also required me to participate in a tele-conference call with XXXX XXXX and my mortgage company to confirm information that they already had in writing from my mortgage company. They confirmed the loan was up to date and the principleb balance on the loan. It was a complete waste of time and I had to step away from my job to do it. I sent an email on XXXX to XXXX confirming that the call had been completed. He also informed me that we were still waiting on written verification of my employment. and that the process could take several days. I was getting very irritated by this point. I mentioned to XXXX and to XXXX that I was getting the strong impression that the underwriting team no longer wanted to do business with me and that they were making me jump through a lot of hoops to find a way to get out of funding the loan. I also expressed at that time that the process that was supposed to take 6-8 weeks was now on week 10 and I was getting upset with recent series of events on a loan that was conditionally approved a long time ago. They reassured me and sent the remaining items back to underwriting on XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX that only said. Your file was returned to me and underwriting is DECLINING the loan due to more than 2 late payments in the last 24 months. I apologize. 
I am furious over this I wasted a ton of time and expense and lost wages on getting everything they asked for. I was very up front about our troubles and credit rebuild and that the lien unknown to us could be paid with loan proceeds etc ... but what gets me the most is that they could see those late payments from the VERY Beginning! I feel taken and advantage of, lied to, and discriminated against because of our extenuating circumstance. We have never filed a bankruptcy, have no collections accounts, and our collateral appraised {$22000.00} higher than expected! They requested information that wasn't needed in the loan process including a signed and dated letter from my husband who was not on the loan because his legal employment pay was not good enough or too much trouble for them to deal with explaining to them his relationship to his own company. Also a bank statement showing how we paid for the XXXX loan, who cares it's paid off in full and closed it no longer is a factor! I want someone to look at this because these lending practices were far outside of normal I feel like they are cherry picking their clients instead of lending based on set criteria.",Mortgage

For example they said that my XXXX where not received because They have not validated my account prior to that. 

This is absurd and a LIE as XXXX have validated that my transfer was succesfully received by their bank. 

Futhermore the validation is irrelevant. Indeed my colleague XXXX XXXX XXXX have sent a tranfer of XXXX by XXXX to their same account and they have put the money to his account. Here his account had never been validated prior the XXXX being sent, yet was still received and loaded to his EURO wallet successfully. 

Weirdly when the some is Eur XXXX things miraculously disappear ... 


In any vent they have admitted that they failed to action my sepa but are not providing any resolution and are still keeping a Total of EUR XXXX held in their account. 


Every time I attempted to call them. I had to wait an average of 50min on the line, very often you ca n't get through to anyone and when you do. The call will drop. 

They will escalate the call to a specialist which can not and is not allowed to answer any meaningful question about whether or not they did they receive my Transfers where are them, when will the be loaded so that I can finalise my BTC transaction.. 

I have research multiple forum and it seems that a lot of users are complaining that their fund are being held hostage when large amount are being sent..

Each time Ocwen would claim the remarks were "" Mandatory '' even though all the bureaus said they were completely "" Optional '' and each time the remarks were different. 
XXXX XXXX became my next point of contact in the Ocwen Ombudsman 's office. In a soft spoken, serious voice he would send me on back to back wild goose chases to verify if the accusations he made against XXXX, then XXXX, then XXXX again were true or false. It was a great burden on me to write letters, make phone calls and check out the accusations and in each case what XXXX XXXX claimed was caused by XXXX or XXXX was in fact caused by OCWEN. XXXX XXXX would make serious accusations against XXXX, accusing them of changing the XXXX score. I told him that from now on he needed to put his accusations in writing. He did put in writing that OCWEN puts score lowering statements on MANY Ocwen accounts, remarks that are optional but OCWEN has made a mandatory internal policy to lower scores however they can. XXXX XXXX told me many of the "" errors '' he correct could "" happen again '' and he would fix them again. I contacted his supervisor and his supervisor 's supervisor. The sheer number of times there have been "" errors '' on my account since XXXX XXXX is proof that OCWEN is either the most incompetent organization on earth or engaging in criminal activity or perhaps both. I feel like I have been financially kidnapped by OCWEN and denied my Constitutional rights. OCWEN is engaging in a form of slavery. Even after OCWEN it told not to overturn loan mods, they started the process of overturning my XX/XX/XXXX loan modification. They only put the process on hold because XXXX XXXX told me to report OCWEN to the CFPB. They have indicated to me that it could happen in the future and that the assumption of the loan could be reversed again, my credit score could be messed up again by incorrect info reported by OCWEN. They threatened me by telling me every time I report them it to the Attorney General and the CFPB, it causes them to do things that harm my credit score, that it 's my fault",Mortgage

"I had been a valued, paying customer of XXXX  since XX/XX/XXXX. I called XXXX  to speak with a representative on XX/XX/XXXX to have my account transferred to a new service address beginning XX/XX/XXXX. My account had to be up to date for a transfer of service which it was at this time. The request was supposed to only be for a transfer of service under my current account not an establishment of new service. My account was what I presumed to be transferred on XX/XX/XXXX and an agent came out to my home and connected the equipment that I brought from my previous service address. From that point I had again been a valued, paying customer of XXXX.

Around XX/XX/XXXXwe began the process of buying a home. After having my credit ran I was informed of a new collections account that was posted to my credit through a credit agency, Diversified Consultants. Soon after I received my first notice from Diversified Consultants about a XXXX  account that was in collections for {$910.00} that was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted XXXX  to obtain more information about this collection since I knew that my current account was up to date and in good standing. I spoke with XXXX, account representative, upon my first contact in regards to this matter. The rep reviewed my account and placed a ticket # XXXX into the system to review this situation.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called again because I had not received a callback as was promised by the last agent regarding this matter. On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, account representative. I had to reiterate the entire situation. XXXX  at that time place another ticket # XXXX  for the issue to be reviewed and resolved. It had be determined that the actual amount owed was {$140.00}. I tried to pay this amount at that time because I needed the situation resolved as I was in the middle of a obtaining a home loan. I was advised by the agent not to pay this amount until I was contacted by a manager or supervisor at a later date. However, I never received a phone call.

My next call was on XX/XX/XXXX in regards to the initial ticket # XXXX and # XXXX. I spoke with XXXX at this time. This like my 2 previous calls turned in to hour long conversations as the representative and their unnamed supervisors reviewed my account. At the end of this conversation I stressed to the rep XXXX that I was in the midst of a home buying process and i needed this collections account issue resolved rapidly. I was again promised a call back which I never received.

Today XX/XX/XXXX in efforts to go ahead and take care of the balance of {$140.00} that I was told I owed by two different agents I made a payment of {$140.00} ( this amount because I did not remember exactly how much was owed ).

I gave each one a run down of the situation. I was told that the issue would take another 48-72 hours to be reviewed and credited appropriately.

At this point I am fed up with dealing with XXXX  and their credit agency Diversified Consultants. I am still a paying customer with an up to date account at my current address. I wish to have this collections account removed from my credit report so that I can proceed with my home loan.

"Re : Request to Reinvestigate & Delete Accounts Re : Full name : XXXX XXXX XXXX SS # : XXXX Date of Birth : XX/XX/XXXX Current Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Florida XXXX Legal Department, I am a victim of identity- theft, I am writing to request that you block all the following fraudulent accounts in my files with XXXX , XXXX , and XXXX. This information does not relate to any transactions I made. I did not authorize anyone to use my personal information. I hereby exercise my legal rights enacted by Congress and The Federal Trade Commission, which explicitly states when a victim files an affidavit it shall be honored by all credit bureaus and all fraudulent information must be blocked within 4 days and proper notification shall be given to all furnishers pursuant to section 605b of The Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. Failure to comply shall lead to complaints being filed with The XXXX XXXX XXXX, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Attorney General with legal action of your companys unlawful collection practices, misrepresentation of reporting inaccurate debts, and noncompliance to adhere to laws enacted to help who are victims of identity-theft. I request that an extend fraud alert be placed in my file explaining that fraudulent applications may be submitted in my name. Do not extend credit without first contacting me personally and verifying all applications. 

The below-listed accounts by the Original Creditors, who have reported these accounts within my credit reports, were not opened by me. I also did not give my authorization for anyone else to open these accounts. Someone else of who did these that I did not know. 


Policy states. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA 611 ( 15 U.S.C 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy. 

( a ) Reinvestigation ( 1 ) Reinvestigation ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection ( f ), if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumers file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30-day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller. 

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit-reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type of fraudulent activities. 

It must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below-listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve the accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 



It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore, inaccurate in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out go my credit files. 
1.Identity Theft REGIONAL ACCEPTANCE CO Account Number : XXXX This is not mine I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be Blocked and Deleted. 

According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA, Section 1681c ( 2 ) Block of information resulting from identity-theft. 

1.Block. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a consumer reporting shall block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from an alleged identity-theft, not later than four ( 4 ) business days after the date receipt by such agency of 1. Appropriate proof of identity of the consumer ; 2. A copy of an identity theft report 3. The identification of such information by the consumer ; and 4. A statement by the consumer that the information relating to the transaction by the consumer. 

I have provided all of the above listed four ( 4 ) items within this package. Therefore, I expect these listed accounts to be deleted and blocked within ( 4 ) business days. This is clearly an identity theft issue. I am also entitled to receive a free copy of my credit report, so I am requesting a free credit report and that all of these accounts, public records items, and inquiries be permanently blocked and deleted.

All XXXX reports are stating these codes : XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX XXXX ; XXXX XXXX. 

I have been trying to buy a house now for at least 2 years. The only credit inquiries have been due to the fact of expiration of the 90-day length of time of the initial credit-report. I have paid-off my car, and Now I am penalized for that pay-off. I do NOT have any revolving accounts. Any credit cards-3- that I use are paid off monthly. There is always a full balance paid off prior to the due date. How can there be "" too many inquiries '' based on a renewal of credit from the same institution?

I am also disputing the credit reporting as basically being based on a BIAS of the algorithms that are being used based on my age. Nothing has changed in my credit profile in reality other than the fact that the algorithms keep dropping the "" CREDIT SCORE '' based on internal DESIGN BIAS inherent in the algorithm development. In fact, my income has increased, and there is no reflection whatsoever as to the REAL CREDIT ACCOUNTS HISTORIES. 

The Credit reports are most probably more erroneous for many other people. There is a definite AGE BIAS in this program. I DO NOT have any balances of unpaid amounts due with any Financial Institutions for more than 5 years.

When a person such as myself calls the number for Corelogic Credco, the only prompts are ONLY for FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. There is no advisory on the credit score disclosure of any contact number for the CITIZEN that the credit report is reporting about. If you can not recognize the inherent bias in the present system, then you definitely do not have any common sense as to how the real citizens function to actually make any STATE/NATION real! 

What happened to what used to be a requirement of advising the CITIZEN as to what number to call/contact for a complaint about any erroneous information on the REPORT clearly printed on the paper of the report, by Algorithms to other Algorithms to then be used against citizens? That is the least that any one should expect from a totally automated financial system that is most effectively not being used to support any activities that could support real citizens, especially in the US.

You can't have any kind of system of systems that works without citizens. The entire focus of the present system is totally WRONG.

Second issue is Mr. XXXX disclosed and committed prior to my application that Rate.com does not sell its loans and my loan would not be sold or assigned.

"Friday, XX/XX/XXXX This complaint is an addendum and follow up to the original complaint filed : the number is XXXX, as US Banks bad behavior just won't quit. Apologies for the typos in the XXXX  letter. This is what happens when you have a life outside of having to put up with US Banks poor treatment of you. The list is so long I can not even discuss everything here. Luckily I was able to capture most of it in the previous letters and this one. 

While I am still waiting to hear back from XXXX XXXX XXXX promised to call me on XX/XX/XXXX ), and now XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX promised to call me on T, XX/XX/XXXX ), a third party that has no access to my personal checkings and savings accounts, has now brought to my attention that US Bank is claiming that they closed my accounts for me. As usual, absolutely no calls or emails to me on this from the folks that promised to call me back to help resolve this. As usual, theyre always pulling their underhanded games when I in fact closed my account officially on XX/XX/XXXX when I notifed the XXXX, XXXX in email. I am through with all of their sly and low-balling games. 

XXXX XXXX confirmed with me in early XXXX that their standard is for the person that I reach out to that is supposed to call me back within XXXX hours or sooner is supposed to call me back within that time frame. They have rarely upheld themselves to this standard as evidenced in all the emails sent to you so far, among so many other standards they never adhere and uphold to with me. They are also speaking to a third party about my private personal and checking accounts and not directly to me even after Ive already told them that I wont accept their slow mail anymore as a result of how badly theyve treated me for so long. 

US Bank continues their unethical practices with their untrustworthiness, lies, stonewalling, passive aggressiveness, etc. While they are claiming that they closed my accounts for me, I closed them on my own accord finally after many forewarnings I provided them, as a result of all of their negligence in refusing to respond to my multiple attempts to reach out to them about an original concern that they refused too resolve effectively and efficiently. 

XXXX XXXX has a track record of her negligence, excuses, stonewalling tactics, etc, years before I finally submitted my official closing of my accounts in my final email to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She's never in her office every time I call, or she stepped out, I leave a message, she never calls back. or she has someone else calls me when I need to talk to HER! Shes always on vacation. The front has lied to me saying she is not in the office when I found out through others that she in fact IS in her office, etc. So many occasions this happened now. Back to the final email on XXXX to XXXX This was after he promised to call me the Friday Before. As usual, no call. I follow up on the following Monday, still no call. So I sent him the email on my own accord to clos everything. Hours later that same day, Mr XXXX XXXX  leaves a message on phone saying that obviously they got the email and that they are sending things in the mail. But this is premature. My new bank said the easiest way to transfer all of my funds WITH NO FEES, is to wire transfer everything over. 

This group has had several opportunities in the past -- - I mean, SEVERAL, and they blew every single forgiving chance I gave THEM to rectify the situation with my original request. But of course, they add insult to injury by ignoring and gaslighting me in literally every situation. The most well-behaved individual out of the lot was Ms. XXXX XXXX who would not have even reached out to me had I not taken the time to fill out one of their surveys. I am not saying that shes fantastic, but she is far better than the rest. At least that was how she presented herself to me that day. But as usual, the original problem is still not solved. 

This type of white collar criminal behavior ( unethical ) - the negligence, the stonewalling, the refusal to handle my funds properly -- warrants individuals in this organization like Ms. XXXX and the other offenders to be sent to prison. Their choice of behaviors with how they mis-treat customers and mishandle peoples ' money XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, shows me month after month, year after year that she deserves to get the same treatment from other bullies out there since this group is so quick to dish out this type of unprofessionalism and negligence. 

Their claim that "" Our goal is to provide efficient, accurate, and courteous service, and we share our disappointment in learning we have not lived up to these expectations/standards. '' So far, based on all behaviors and negligence and horrible customer service and attitude committed to say at the very least, this group continues to lie and promise "" efficient, accurate and courteous service ''. US BANK MOST DEFINITELY DOES NOT PROVIDE "" EFFICIENT, ACCURATE, AND COURTEOUS SERVICE '' the majority of the time. 
THE EXCEPTION OF THIS IS MR. XXXX XXXX AT THE XXXX BRANCH. BUT HE IS A RARE EXCEPTI. SADLY, THE BANK IS NOT A XXXX MAN TEAM, SO US BANK NEEDS TO FIRE ALL THE OTHER MIND JOBS AND RECRUIT AND HIRE MORE XXXX 'S FOR SURE. 
US Bank has proven to me over and over again that their words mean nothing and I can not trust them one bit. If they wish to keep at least some shred of self-respect, they'd be very wise to re-open up all accounts so that I can re-wire back to my new bank which I like so much better and most of my family members go to others banks as such. Also, fire Ms. XXXX. 

Once I am DONE talking to a group that his mistreated me so poorly, I am DONE reaching out to them. And I am also done reading their mail.. I am no longer accepting anymore mail from this group, nothing. While they are incredibly lucky I showed them forgiveness and mercy and talked to them to give then time to improve, as usual, they blew it. MORE MORE! 

I had better see all of my accounts AT ONCE reopened and NO FUNNY FEES AND CHARGES TO MY ACCOUNTS, for me to wire my money over to my new bank. No XXXX XXXX. 

1 ) This past Monday, Ms. XXXX XXXX promised me that she would reopen my accounts for me to handle my money and that she would call me the very next day Not surprising that she too, broke her promise to me, and neglected calling me back. 

It was also very harassing and unprofessional of her to go off on how "" one should pick up the phone for something important like this ''. Firstly, in no way did I ever say to this female that i don't pick up my phone. Also, it is really none of her business if the customer chooses to not pick up the phone or not. Customers work too just like US Bank employees, but apparently she was too dense to understand this. 

I expect individual letters of apologies from Every person I have emailed in the records shown to you for their criminal and unprofessional behavior at the very least. Ms. XXXX, Mr. XXXX, Mr XXXX XXXX  for not responding to my original which prompted me to have to reach out to Mr. XXXX in the first place, Mr XXXX XXXX, Ms. XXXX now at the XXXX XXXX XXXX and her rude employee ( XXXX XXXX XXXX that never even smiled at me and just made me stand there in silence without saying anything to me for like five minutes at a time. Newcombs employee also lied to me repeatedly and would always evade answering me when I had to ask her more than XXXX times the branch XXXX 's name. She still refused to give me the branch XXXX 's name although I asked for Ms. XXXX 's business card, and to cover herself, she then said "" XXXX '' after the fact when XXXX already walked out to see me. 

FOR THE RECORD : XX/XX/XXXX, I CANCELLED MY ACCOUNTS WITH US BANK ON MY OWN ACCORD. BUT I STILL NEED TO HAVE THEM OPEN UP MY ACCOUNTS WITH ALL MY MONEY IN IT, ( NO FEES, ETC ), FOR ME TO TRANSFER FUNDS FROM THE APP AND THEN PAY MY CREDIT CARD BILL TOO. WHILE I SHOWED THIS TO MS. XXXX, SHE JUST IGNORED ME FOR XXXX MINUTES AT THE TIME AFTER I WOULD ANSWER ALL HER QUESTIONS PROMPTLY, THEN SHE WOULD GIVE ME SILENCE FOR XXXX MINUTES AT A TIME, WHILE MAKING ME JUST STAND THEIR IN SILENCE WITH MY PAINFUL FOOT LESIONS. 

THANK YOU CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION BUREAU FOR EVEERYTHING. THIS GROUP IS FULL OF LIES AND ABSOLUTELY NO INTEGRITY. PLEASE MAKE SURE THEY RE-OPEN UP ALL MY ACCOUNTS FOR ME TO TRANSFER ON MY BEFORE I WOULD HAVE TO GET SOME LEGAL ADVICE. 

thank you for understanding how I am legitimately livid about all of these unethical people at US Bank with Low integrity. Please have re-open my accounts for me to effectively wire all my money to my new banks of choice and thank you in Advance.

The postcard was mailed to me, with my full correct first and last name, and my full correct current address. The postcard is titled Change of Address Notification. Inside the postcard states, Your Wells Fargo contract information has been updated. The postcard then goes on to say, Recently, we updated the address for your Wells Fargo accounts in response to your request or a notification we received from the United States Postal Service. Please note that the reason weve sent this postcard to the last address on file is to ensure that in fact you have changed your address. Your address has been updated on the following accounts : XXXX Platinum Debit Card and XXXX WELLS FARGO CLEAR ACCESS BANKING. If you did not update your address, or do not want this new address associated with your accounts, please call us immediately at XXXX, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You may have also received this communication via email. -Sign on at wellsfargo.com or the Wells Fargo mobile app and go to Update Contact Information. Thank you. We appreciate your business.

I found Wells Fargos Customer Service number via XXXX and called them at XXXX at XXXX XXXX. I do not recall the name of the woman who answered the call. She immediately asked for my full social security number. I informed her of the above information, advised her that the accounts did not belong to me, and requested that they be closed. I advised her that I did not feel comfortable giving her my full SSN. At this point, it appears to me that Wells Fargo has already fraudulently misused my full correct name and address, so I certainly do not feel comfortable providing them with even more of my personal information. The woman informed me that she was unable to access anything without me being able to provide her with either the full account number or my full SSN. She then transferred me to a man ( I dont recall his name either ) who informed me of the same, and advised I visit a local branch in person to resolve the issue in person. There is not a local branch in my city. And at this point, I have already spent at least 3 hours on the phone and/or online with Wells Fargo , CFPB, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX just to resolve this issue and prevent any damages. I certainly do not wish to spend more time and money traveling to resolve this issue.

"My mother died on XX/XX/XXXX, and had what appears to be a predatory loan ( designed to fail ) with Wells Fargo Bank, which I thought was for a motor home purchased in XX/XX/XXXX, and would soon be paid in full. Even after providing Wells Fargo with my mothers Death Certificate, the Probate papers appointing me as the person of interest ( executor ) of her estate, and Durable Power of Attorney, Wells Fargo has been defiant at providing me copies of the complete loan papers, including moms signature and the Notary stamp/signature and dates.

This loan was supposedly originated on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of $ XXXX@ 8.75 % ( variable XXXX + the XXXX XXXX   Offered Rate thru-a maximum of 14.750 % ) interest and on a 30 year Home Equity Contract ( home assessed value in XX/XX/XXXX of : {$71000.00}, or 104 % of the home 's assessed value ).

So since I originally paid for the item before the cancellation, the money was deducted from my Bank of America checking account. And I wasn't able to afford the new price because it would take a day before the money from the original purchase would be refunded to my bank account. So the seller encouraged me to send them money through XXXX, which is a money transferring service I can access through my Bank of America account.

After the transfer, the seller responds by thanking me and giving me shipment details, hours later the seller forwards me an email from Bank of America stating that the email I sent the money to was removed from their account. So the seller says they can't see any money in their bank account.

"I am disputing a current charge of {$6700.00} ( originally {$7200.00} ) to my Platinum card ( ending in XXXX ) account. The charge is in error because I did not authorize this transaction, which consisted of a {$7200.00} cash advance. Associated fees ( interest fee and cash advance fee ) have since been resolved and a credit of {$420.00} was debited to the account, however a balance of {$6700.00} remains. I received a notice of statement via email on XX/XX/XXXX, which reflects the erroneous charge. I did not authorize this transaction and did not give my authorization to anyone to perform this transaction on my behalf. A fraudster had gained access to my online account and initiated the XXXX XXXX of {$7200.00} from the XXXX XXXX to my Checking Account. From the Checking Account, the fraudster then sent the {$7200.00} + {$1900.00} from my checking account ( Total of {$9100.00} ) via a wire transfer to a bank that I do not have an account with and that I have no association with. 

I am requesting that the error be corrected, that any finance or other charges related to the disputed amount be credited to my account, and that I get an accurate statement. 

Per the Fair Credit Billing Act, Wells Fargo has up to 2 billing cycles to conduct your investigation and was not allowed by federal law to charge me a payment during the course of this investigation. During this time, Wells Fargo was not allowed to try to collect the payment, charge interest on it, or report it to credit bureaus as late. However, this practice was not exercised during the investigation, which is reflected on the electronic statement ( dated XX/XX/XXXX ) attached. An amount of {$7600.00} was still an active charge, which caused my account to be over limit ( credit card limit is {$7500.00} ). This resulted in the account being reported to the Credit Bureaus as Over Credit Limit ( as reflected by the XXXX Alert attached ) and a 37 point decrease in my credit score. As of now, the fees have been resolved- however, a balance of {$6700.00} still reflects on this account, despite the report and confirmation by multiple Wells Fargo representatives that this transaction was "" clearly fraud '' and "" indeed fraud '', which I "" shouldn't have to pay because it is not your fault ''. A Minimum Payment of {$68.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX. I have reported to Wells Fargo multiple times that this balance is fraud. The Fair Credit Billing Act dictates that I have 60 days to dispute a credit card charge. I have made multiple phone claims and filed several complaints through CFPB, as well as XXXX I have mailed a letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX, which is within the 60 day time frame from when the statement containing the erroneous charge was made available online ( XX/XX/XXXX ). Furthermore, because I have reported the fraud within this 60 day timeframe and it is greater than {$50.00}, Wells Fargo is restricted by federal law from collecting payment, charging interest on the fraudulent balance, reporting this balance to the credit bureaus as late. If any of these things occur, I will be serving Wells Fargo with legal notice in accordance with the rights provided to me by the Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) and Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) via my attorney. 

Enclosed are copies of the email dated XX/XX/XXXX that notified me of available electronic account statement, the statement dated XX/XX/XXXX that reflects the erroneous charge and XXXX Credit Notification of decrease in score and Over Limit Account notice, supporting my position and claims.

This payment too was returned for the same reason. 

I called OCWEN yet again, and spoke with Agent # ...., on the afternoon of Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX, we went around and around with my account numbers and he did not feel comfortable taking my banking information, because he could not be sure it would go through and then he told me that if the payment was not in by XX/XX/XXXX, it would go to collections.

I am well aware of several other complaints filed against this company for their illegal and unethical business practices. Yet, somehow, this company is still in business. This company 's unprofessional & negligent behavior has caused lots of serious harm, not only to my ability to establish credit & good interest rates, but also to my character as a Professional and as an individual. Please help me, and the many other consumers just like me, to put a stop to the operation of these unethical & immoral business practices immediately.

I recently discovered that Summit Account Resolution is reporting a debt that I do not owe to all three credit bureaus. After discovering this discrepancy I reached out via certified mail to Summit Account  Resolutions providing proof of full payment made to the original creditor and also requested removal of the negative account being reported. Summit replied by mail still requesting that I remit payment for a debt that I do not owe ( refusal to remove negative account ).

It was deducted from my Bank account by electronic funds transfer ( EFT ). On XX/XX/XXXX their system automatically deducted an additional {$2700.00} payment and treated it like it was a regular mortgage payment, deducting for interest and escrow. 
I tried for weeks to get my money back by calling them and sending messages, but I still have not received a check or EFT refund of {$2700.00} as of the date of this letter. Two agents told me that the funds would be returned by EFT and the rest said that the check was mailed on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX a supervisor called me. He said his name was XXXX with an employee ID of XXXX. He said that a check had been mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX but offered no proof that a check had actually been mailed. He suggested to me that I call my bank and ask them to stop payment on the XX/XX/XXXX overpayment. I told him that I thought it was probably too late to do that, but that I would try. He agreed to call me the next evening to follow-up. 
I called my bank on XX/XX/XXXX and they stopped the payment immediately and refunded my {$2700.00}. That evening XXXX called again, and I told him the good news.

To avoid having their system charge me with a late payment, I submitted a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, to be paid on XX/XX/XXXX. Again, their system has deducted the payment twice, apparently because their system has recorded that I never paid my XX/XX/XXXX payment. This is a nightmare.

Before involving the legal system, I have been advised to take measured steps as required by law to resolve the issue with Shellpoint. 

I received a letter from Ms. XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, that still placed the blame on me, stating that if this happens again, Shellpoint will not be willing to take the necessary steps to correct the issue ( AGAIN, I HAD NO CONTROL OR FAULT IN A CODE THAT WAS PLACED IN YOUR SYSTEM ), and it also indicated that my account was late for XXXX. Again, one if those issues where I have no control in when Shellpoint sets up bi-weekly payments.

I am also contacting a local advocate, XXXX XXXX, and her advocacy group called, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and plan to submit my evidence to the local media to investigate if there are others who are getting the same treatment from Shellpoint as myself.

Please see the attached letter from Ms. XXXX, and I will itemize below the changes to the letter that I requested.

'' -I XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX had no responsibility in the system being coded in that manner and I am requesting an investigation into how this happened. 

As of this correspondence, the account is past due XX/XX/XXXX for {$1000.00} -I XXXX XXXX is requesting that a new letter be drafted and this be removed as I indicated to Ms. XXXX that this is inaccurate information and requested that this be updated nor removed in a new letter.

Not sure if she is upset in correcting this issue or if she is upset for some other reason. Nonetheless, this was not necessary to be included in the letter.

We made all subsequent payments, but were nevertheless assessed late fees, again after paying on time. ( Again, we have screen shots of the account which confirm this ). As the letter submitted by Synchrony Bank in response to the initial complaint confirms the account was restored to good standing, and as we made each of the next two payments on time ( easily confirmed through the due dates and the dates the checks were cashed by Synchrony ), there was no justifiable reason to assess late fees. Yet in XX/XX/XXXX, a {$35.00} late fee was again assessed, after a full payment of {$84.00} was processed before the due date. 

At this point, we resubmitted our complaint, because Synchrony Bank was simply non -responsive. ( It is a policy, apparently, of Synchrony Bank to conduct all conversations with customers over the phone, which does not allow for written records to be maintained by the customer. We insist on all correspondence with this company, given their track record of questionable practices, to be in writing. Because the company makes this almost impossible, we are struggling to communicate with them. ) The second complaint was met with less consideration, which may be seen via the written response posted here to that complaint, which we filed in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, we have been unwilling to send additional payments, as they are NOT honored or processed fairly. This has led, inevitably, to additional late fees and threats from the company - in addition, because they will NOT communicate with us in writing ( email or regular mail ), we have reached an impasse. 

Our credit has been adversely affected by this situation, and we are now beyond frustrated. We will make the necessary payments to bring this account to good standing, but we expect a full refund of ALL late fees, as well as repair to our credit. 
We also demand that this account be closed. We will certainly NOT do business with Synchrony Bank, under any circumstances, again. 

We would also ask that a more comprehensive investigation into the late fee/payment policies of Synchrony Bank. It seems very apparent that we are not the only ones being victimized in this manner.",Credit card or prepaid card

"I had this account for 15 years. At that time it was XXXX, then that was sold to Metro bank, and now First National bank bought it. I never had a problem until First National bank got into the picture. The buried me in overdraft fees and any other fees they could think of. They took XXXX direct deposites and paid themselves, at that point there is no funds to pay anything else. I was n't aware this was going on because one the bank card was demagnitized, two I felt my direct deposites were covering my charges which were XXXX dollars XXXXdollars gas food, and the big one was paying the rent. My direct deposite is from a part time job, however it 's important to me because it helps me pay the rent, I 'm a widower I live with XXXX kids and put food on the table. What I do n't understand about First National bank is that why is it when there is insufficient funds they do n't simply close the account instead of charging overdraft fees. They do n't have anything written that they have the right to have overdraft fees, so I do n't understand how they can charge me fees take everything then hand it over to a collection agency. There is something fundamentally wrong that allows a bank to do this, to the point of bankrupting an account holder. I have been in contact with them on Fridays because that was the only time I had available, one gentleman looked at my account looked at the fees, then said he did n't have the authority to waive any fees and directed me to his manager XXXX XXXX. She was supposed to get in contact with me and never did, I went back the following Friday and told him what I wanted which was to have my direct deposites returned to me because I earned them, second I want the fees waived, thirdly I want the account closed. He wrote that down and told me the regional manager has the authority to do so his name is XXXX XXXX, and then never heard a word from him. Meanwhile I feel as though they were stalling, eating out the clock so they can bring it to a collection agency so they do n't have anything to do about it. While this was going on I opened up another account and had my money moved to that account because it would have been an endless viscious cycle. That other account, there 's an agreement that if there is insufficient accounts there would be a decline when swiped. To have this thing go one and owe an exuberent amount of money baffles me and the only thing I can conclude on is that this is how the bank makes its money. So they are looking to create scenarios to look into your account and to go around doing this.

On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was injured and could n't work and fell behind on my Chase mortgage. During the whole time that I could n't work I maintained contact with Chase and they told me that they were going to work with me. On Monday XX/XX/XXXX I went back to work and I contacted Chase to inform them that I would be making a payment. On Thursday XX/XX/XXXX I received foreclosure papers and when I called Chase they told me that they will not accept any payments and that they would send any payments back. I owed them XXXX that I could have easily paid them. So I hired a mortgage legal group to stop the foreclosure process and help modify my loan and they was able to stop the foreclosure but Chase would n't work out anything with me .So Chase sent more foreclosure papers out and I had to hire another mortgage group to stop the foreclosure and try and get approved for a modification or a repayment plan. Chase turned me down again and just gave me the run around when I asked for an explanation for being denied. I spent XXXX or more with XXXX home mortgage companies trying to save my house when chase could have just accepted my payments. In the meanwhile my mortgage is getting farther behind and I could n't go get a loan to catch my mortgage up because its showing up on my credit for being late so I had to file for bankruptcy to stop Chase for foreclosing on me again and during bankruptcy they still would n't modify my loan or offer me a repayment plan. During this time I have continued to pay my house payment along with {$200.00} to {$400.00} extra per month. When I realized that my back payment was not decreasing I contacted Chase and was told that they were holding the extra money because they could n't apply it until they received a full payment. In the mean time my note is increasing further and further behind. Each time I contacted Chase they would tell me to re apply and to appeal my modification. Each time I was denied for different reasons. The only thing that they offered me is a short sale for my home.

"Please see complaint XXXX ; this complaint was submitted XX/XX/XXXX ; I have never received a response, and it still shows as they are gathering their response on your site. 
Instead of responding to the complaint submitted XX/XX/XXXX this company simply redrafted and resubmitted paperwork for garnishment. They have yet to validate this debt as asked and required. 
To resend/submit this to my employer for garnishment, they increased the amount owed and added my ex-husbands name to the paperwork. From what I gleaned when I first received a call regarding this, my ex-husband 's name was not included, so why would they include now? 
Again, this company rolled the last payment received date to accommodate their supposed suit against me. This so-called debt is over 20 years old, and the statute of limitations has long passed. They are being unethical and I do not believe what they have done here is legal ; the only resolution is for this to be waived and taken off my record. 
Please see below for pasted initial complaint sent XX/XX/XXXX : On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a strange voicemail stating I needed to call a number regarding a court case against me. I called the number was told they were merely an answering service, and was transferred to an outside "" office ''. A woman answered, she stated she worked for an attorney.

I informed her this has to be fraud, as I did not have a credit card in XXXX and have had many loans for cars and a home after XXXX, surely this would have been brought to my attention during any of those transactions. I asked her for proof, she became difficult to deal with, stated that they do not make appointments to "" serve '' me with paperwork. I asked her then how am I to know what this is really about and be able to speak on my own behalf? The woman stated that I clearly did not want to know the information and didn't care and repeated that they would just get a judgment against me. I stated to her that not only was this fraud, tis happened 19 years ago, if this was valid, statute of limitations expired many years ago. The woman would not assist me, would not give me information to be able to obtain any paperwork so that I could fight for myself and the call was ended. From this point, I called the local courthouse in XXXX Ca., I was told they had NO open cases with my name attached, and that there was a lot of fraud happening, and this fit that description as they would have to had any hearing in my local county.

"While processing a refinance mortgage with Freedom Mortgage on multiple occasions they provided inaccurate paperwork and broke the terms of the closing documents. First, after requesting a mortgage without an impound/escrow account, Freedom Mortgage sent a set of summary disclosure forms with an impound/escrow account included.

Its been XXXXour weeks and we have not received a reply or follow-up from Freedom Mortgage. In fact, per the closing documents the first payment wasnt due until XX/XX/2021, but regardless of our request to cancel the refinance, Freedom Mortgage closed our previous mortgage and deducted a payment on XX/XX/2021.

Portfolio never made me an offer that was accepted by me, they have failed to provide me consideration of any form and they have never proven any other financial entities that that are claiming to have initiated the alleged debt instilled a right to assignment in any contract they provided. Therefore, Portfolio has never proven a right to the existence of any such debt as well as the legitimacy to collect on besides some hearsay Bill of Sale, which proves nothing and offered me no consideration with regards to this issue.

"This is a follow up of complaint XXXX. 
I have been attempting to work with SPS servicing for over 3 months. It is without a doubt in my mind that the only objective this company has is to fraudulently delay and stall all processes in order to keep this file from closing and keep collecting fees for servicing. They are committing fraud to their investors and if their investors knew what they are doing they would investigate this company. I am a XXXX and I am very familiar with process. I have literarily called this company over 50 times over the past 70 days. Every single time I call them they fabricate a new required document that was not needed the previous day. I will literally call, get a supervisor, they will review the file, they will say you need a document. I will ask if they need anything else and they will say no. The very next day I will call, and they will say "" oh '' and we need this document. I send them each document with in the same day. I ask the supervisor if they need anything else again and they say no. Then again, I call the very next day and all of a sudden again they need another document. It is like the movie "" Ground Hogs Day '' every day is literally the same. This has happen literally 40 times on the same file. 
Example : I supplied the supervisor with a closing discloser. I called them, and they said we need to change it to show how much the difference is in the pay off and the amount of the loan. We submitted. Few days later they said, we need you to change the HUD to so that it says something different in the same line items. We submitted it. I called back two days later. They said, we don't understand what this means, so I asked them to give me the exact language to put on the line item. They provided the exact language. The supervisor walked over the short sale department and had them tell us the exact words they wanted on the line item. I sent it to the supervisor while on the phone and XXXX XXXX ( supervisor ) said it was exactly what they wanted. I called back two days later and talked with XXXX XXXX ( supervisor ) and he says the HUD is wrong and that we need to remove the short amount numbers and show the amount of the total payoff not the short sale difference. This is after I had changed the HUD three times. 
Further example : Every time they submit a document or need a document they say, "" the investor has reviewed the file and they require another document. '' They somehow get a new requirement for a document directly from the investor in a day or two and then we keep submitting. Now finally after submitting all the documents multiple times they now say it is going to take a while ( no real date here ) for the investor to review the file. 
I have talked to the following people numerous times : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. These are all supervisors. This is how many times I have called this company that I have a list of most of their supervisors. 
How is it that the investor can review the file so quickly when they find a missing document but now they are going to take a longer time frame once they have all the documents. How is it that the investor has seen this file for 45 days and now suddenly the need time to review the file they have been looking at for 45 days. 
We missed the first closing because SPS servicing is fraudulently delaying the process. Now we have extended the closing toXX/XX/2018 closing. All parties are ready to close. All money is ready. The sale price is {$10000.00} above the BOV. 
This company is committing fraud to its investors. It is completely evident beyond a shadow of a doubt that SPS Servicing Inc is with all intent purposely delaying the process a part of their modus operandi to stall or cause deals to fall apart so the company can maintain accounts and collect fees from it investors for servicing. They with intent created processes that prevent anyone from successfully completing a short sale process so that they will keep the file on their books and not lose the servicing fees. 
I have worked with this company for almost 3 months and they have repeated shown this trend in behavior. Not once have I called and received the same answer twice. Not once have a called when they did not create a new requirement that was not there the next day. 
They are committing fraud to their investors and they need to be investigated immediately.",Mortgage

In response I sent a certified letter to XXXX advising that I do not recall owing such a debt, there was no validation of debt received, furthermore, any statute of limitations, if owed, would have expired ( see attachment for further explanation ). 

XXXX did respond advising that it would not seek further recovery and returned the matter to HARVEST. I thought that was the end of an alleged debt where no supporting information was received, or where it had been proven that the statute of limitations had not expired. 

Now, not even a month later, I received another demand for payment, of the same alleged debt, from XXXX ( XXXX ). XXXX alleges its client is HARVEST, and it is seeking {$13000.00} under account XXXX. It is also alleged that XXXX is the original creditor. I allege I do not owe a debt to XXXX, and that HARVEST and XXXX have no right to seek collection from me. If at any point I did have a XXXX credit card it would have been approximately 10 years ago, while living in California, which means any statute of limitations is long expired. I have not had a credit card, with any sort of large spending limit in years. Furthermore, XXXX chose not to send any sort of information backing its position including when the alleged debt was incurred with XXXX or HARVEST, there was no validation of debt. 

It appears HARVEST, XXXX, and XXXX are basically conspiring to collect an alleged old debt, that I believe is not owed. It appears HARVEST and XXXX are "" Zombie Debt Collectors ''. As indicated above, this can be confirmed by the fact another company, XXXX, just tried to collect the same just months ago. Finally, I believe Dynamic is attempting to harass me as I had reported XXXX to the CFPB previously.",Debt collection

"On XX/XX/XXXX my Wells Fargo debit card was unfortunately stolen. Once I discovered that my card was stolen I immediately reported it to Wells Fargo. Consequently whom ever stole my card gained access to my checking and savings accounts. The fraudulent transactions that took place caused my checking and savings accounts to be over drawn. I have called Wells Fargo everyday since XX/XX/XXXX to get his issue resolved. Wells Fargo manager XXXX id XXXX, advised me that the {$400.00} that is still reflecting in my savings account had been refunded and it was my responsibility to transfer the money from my checking which was negative as well? So, they expected me to know that the credits they gave were for both accounts that I had been advised were XXXX separate accounts. How am I having to pay for something that I did not cause to Wells Fargo? This institution is ultimately stealing from me now, and I feel that I by no way should have to fund my savings account {$400.00}? The purchases and transfers that took place were all authorized my Wells Fargo but were not authorized by me. I am not paying Wells Fargo {$400.00} for something I did not cause nor did I authorize any of these transactions. I need for them to correct he problems.

"I purchased my home XX/XX/XXXX and financed through XXXX XXXX  with a conventional loan. 30 yr fixed loan with 2.75 interest rate. Over the last yr they have been converted to Truist Bank. In XX/XX/XXXX I called in to get some advice and assistance with my mortgage payments because I was behind 2 payments around XXXX and had heard about banks helping with covid relief.

We had all our XXXX children living with us at the time. XXXX  over the age of XXXX and XXXX  under. And to please advise what programs where we eligible for. We talked about several different options.

Go back and forth talking with several different reps all telling something different which are noted in their notes the whole thing was very confusion. I also don't think that the reps where knowledgeable about there products and services. Right after that I excepted a 6 mo. forbearance and at the end, I paid the 6mo owed in full around the amount of XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX I entered in to another forbearance that ends in XX/XX/XXXX. I called in to review my forbearance and pay off options. the Rep began to review my loan and informed me that in XX/XX/XXXX I accepted a modification that saved me XXXX a mo. bringing my payment from XXXX to XXXX mo. by extending my maturity date to XXXX and increased my interest rate to XXXX. I'm completely at loss, I would never accepted those terms had I completely understood. to save an immediate payment for XXXX in exchange for adding over XXXX dollars to my loan at least and doubling my interest rate. As a Financial institution they are required to not only do what is in the best interest for the company but also the customer. I believe with this being a conventional loan they did what was in the best interest of the company and there is no one they have to get approve with or answer to but the bank. This is an unfair practice and unethical and unfair to me the consumer. If this was a FHA loan they would have to adhere by so type of Federal guidelines.

"I am filing this complaint on all three credit bureaus for their involvement in an illegal involving many state and federal government employees, numerous ordinary individuals, employees at all three credit bureaus, XXXX and its XXXX XXXX services, XXXX  and apps, XXXX and XXXX and numerous officers of the courts. I am the targeted individual because of what I know and what I have already proven by documented evidence from Georgia, Illinois and Indiana. I will complete that which XXXX has ordained me to complete. 

I have attempted to correct illegal and incorrect information on my credit report for many years. I have retained some of the reference numbers and confirmation numbers issued by the credit bureaus : XXXX XXXX XXXX File # XXXX, which consist of my complaints against XXXX  XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX # XXXX, XXXX XXXX # XXXX, Experian # XXXX, XXXX # XXXX. All of my complaints have gone without a resolution. 

All three credit bureaus received and stored alleged negative credit information on my credit file, without requiring the furnisher of information to provide legal proof of the negative credit information. All three credit bureaus participated in the electronic data manipulation of my private and personal information, which is ongoing today, especially within all of my email accounts, and my complaints filed with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. All mentioned above have also engaged in altering electronic information within colleges I attended and within data submissions I completed, most recently, while I completed testing at XXXX in XXXX, Indiana. 

XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, continued to file negative credit information in my credit file, while knowing they had no legal right to do so. See first Exhibit attached, which is my copy of the Vehicle Sales Agreement which reveal no lienholder/creditor. I filed a civil action against XXXX XXXX, et al, in the XXXX   District Court of XXXX, with Chief Judge XXXX XXXX presiding, Case # ,1:15-cv-00826-JMS-TAB. Facts and evidence, with this action supports that Judge XXXX XXXX, along with numerous government employees have aided all named Defendants, while denying all my motions to add additional needed defendants to the action. All legal documents I filed in this action was ignored by the Chief Judge and XXXX XXXX was allowed to walk away with clean hands even though their hands are still full of mud from illegal activities relating to this case and involving my life and my chosen liberties. 

The Exhibits are : Plaintffs Exhibit Loyal 2, is a document produced by XXXX XXXX, et al, with a false altered date, entered at the top left side- Order Date : XXXX. XXXX XXXX, et al, produced this fraudulent document from Ars-Iprstaging  and stated this document is the date the Order to Repossess was initiated for my XXXX XXXX XXXX to be Repossessed in XX/XX/XXXX. If you would move down to almost the very end of this document, you will notice the Copyright 2016 Recovery Database Network.  The Copyright clearly reveal this document was created in XXXX, then illegally backed dated to XXXX. This is a crime of spoliation, with the altering of metadata, to willfully commit fraud. Judge XXXX aided in this criminal matter by illegally dismissing my Title VII federal action with prejudice. The next Exhibit B, is one of many denials of credit I received, because of the negative credit information reported by XXXX XXXX, et al to the credit bureaus. God directed me to wait and become educated on Paralegal Courses, I recently completed, whereby the study of spoliation and metadata maniipulation, which is the illegal alterations of electric data history, so that I would gain accurate knowledge of what has been perpetrated against me and why. Exhibit G, is a partial copy of the credit report, which was also filed in my civil action against XXXX XXXX, et al, which reveals, the fraudulent information the credit bureaus allowed to be added to my credit history file. Exhibit D is a collection letter I received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, which is their attempt to collect on a fraudulent debt created by XXXX  XXXX, et al. Exhibit H is another partial credit report, again revealing XXXX XXXX, et al- false information added to my credit file. I fought for years, by requesting the credit bureaus remove this false information from my credit file, to no avail. The recently in XXXX, after Judge XXXX fraud upon the court by allowing XXXX XXXX, et al and the City of XXXX to receive favorable rulings based upon this fraud. 

From the documents I have submitted, it is clear that a legal creditor/debtor relationship never existed between XXXX XXXX, et al and XXXX XXXX. All three credit bureaus failed to protect my credit history from illegal entries. All three credit bureaus failed to maintain a complete credit history for XXXX XXXX. The credit bureaus failed to maintain a complete credit file to sustain my residency in XXXX, XXXX   for many years before relocating to XXXX. I paid off a mortgage at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, prior to my move to XXXX in XXXX. XXXX XXXX credit report # XXXX, reveal my XXXX employment with the City of XXXX, XXXX  but nothing is mentioned that I paid off my mortgage at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. Yet, my credit history has never revealed this payoff, never revealed my accurate credit history. My credit score has never changed from 400-500, until XX/XX/XXXX, with the numerous inquiries by XXXX XXXX and the credit bureaus scheming with XXXX  XXXX to alter my credit score now- because they know I am reaching out to Washington , DC to seek the federal governments aid in this entire matter. 

From my submissions, you can see that I filed numerous complaints, over several years, with all three credit bureaus, with no resolution and with all three credit bureaus ignoring all of my complaints against XXXX  XXXX, et al, XXXX, XXXX and especially IRS, for their numerous tax liens filed against me in XXXX County XXXX for many years, including a fraudulent garnishment of my wages back in XXXX. 

As stated above, in XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, et al, made numerous hits to my credit file, without my knowledge or legal authority to do so. My credit score went up to XXXX as stated by the screen shot attached from Experian. Experian increased my credit score on XX/XX/XXXX. I did nothing to receive this increase in XXXX. 

Since the civil conspiracy against me, is still ongoing, all parties mentioned, as well as other entities and individuals, not yet mentioned, are all equally liable- up to the completion of the last illegal act in the perpetrated civil conspiracy against me which is still ongoing to this date. 

This complaint follows my two previously submitted complaints on XXXX and XXXX to CFPB and CFPB Ombudsman. It appears the conspirators are illegally, by electronic means, interfering with this complaint process, as well. Whereby, electronic data manipulation is evident and I will continue to do everything in the powers that God has given me to expose the cult and their electronic data fraud. I have been the target of electronic data manipulation for years but I gained accurate knowledge of the cult like activities while I was employed at XXXX XXXX XXXX. It was at the center that XXXX targeted me by manipulating my data from XXXX to present. 

I am requesting an investigation on all three credit bureaus on all stated matters, relating to my credit history and credit score being illegally altered, and deliberately kept at a low credit score since the early XXXX. This credit conspiracy against me, has resulted in poor credit ratings, denial of credit and denial of sustainable employment, spanning many years back. I also request that each individual, employed within all three credit bureaus, who are involved in this civil conspiracy, be held accountable, along with XXXX, who appear to be leading the electronic data manipulation conspiracy upon the "" world '', It appears their electronic data manipulation has gone undetected and under the radar of government agencies, until NOW.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

DISCLOSURE : At no time is this a dispute of identity theft or fraud, and I want my dispute answered by the creditor supplying the information on me to be 100 % validated, and/or to see if the timeline for its existence has passed, or if the credit/collection/public record tradeline is on my credit report in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act or a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Any item that I believe is not being validated by the creditor or collection agency or public record vendor will be disputed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at a future date. If the item in dispute is legally valid, I will stand by that validation. We only request validation of information and/or debt ownership. At no time will I dispute a credit reporting agency, as it is imperative to the American free markets that XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX XXXX maintain integrity for the American consumers. 
The following federal laws are what I am basing my rights under : Amended consumer rights Fair Credit Reporting Act Public Law 15 U.S.C. 1681 : https : //www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf Fair Debt Collection Practices Act : https : //www.ftc.gov/enforcement/rules/rulemaking-regulatory-reform-proceedings/fair-debt-collection-practices-act-text I make this request based upon potentially six criteria : 1 ) That I personally agreed and signed a application and/or contract on an extension of credit, and that I may have been late on payments and desire to find an agreed upon timeline when my credit trade line will go to a positive status, or be in position for its legal deletion mandated by the Fair Credit Reporting Act 7-Year rule on the deletion of antiquated information.

2 ) That there may be items on my credit report that was acquired through a public record vendor, and that I may request a fully documented validation of any or all items posted from public record, and upon discovery may request the deletion of the public record postings based upon legal time limits, and/or completed research proving the settled agreements between myself and a second or third party. In and event, if the public record is legal, I will agree upon the trade line being maintained on my credit report until the time arrives where it can legally be removed.

3 ) I may dispute any collection agency that maintains that they are attempting to collect a debt, either for an original creditor I may have had an association with, or if the collection agency maintains that they have acquired the debt. I may request from the debt collector full documentation of assignment of debt collection in written form as mandated by the Federal Trade Commission, including but not limited to verification that the collection agency is bonded and legally approved to collect debts from consumers within my state of residency, and if the agency maintains that the debt has been acquired by purchase, then full documented history of the debt transfer either directly from the original creditor and/or from the securitized trust the debt may have been sold to in a debt portfolio administered through the full regulatory body of the Securities and Exchange Commission. I may in addition request such documentation through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation if that is indeed the governing body of the original credit grantor. 
4 ) I will dispute all public utility payment histories including the collection process assigned to any collection agency, as all public utilities including cell phone charges, natural gas, electric and public violations within municipalities are not governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, but by governing bodies within each state known as public service commissions. At no time will I ever agree upon the postings of public utilities on my credit report, even though I understand that I may volunteer to add my payment histories of this nature at any time.

5 ) I may request the services of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to help me as a potential mediator in cases where I believe that my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act are in violation. At all times I will maintain a professional demeanor on the clearance of negative information on any of my credit reports.

6 ) I will only file a direct complaint with any credit reporting agency if I believe enough evidence has been ascertained showing that the creditor, collection agency and/or public service vendor is in violation of their subscriber agreement with any credit reporting agency.

I may dispute excessive inquiries posted on my credit reports based on the following. As the Federal Trade Commission struggles every year with maintaining the integrity of the credit community, from filing charges against illegal collection practices that abuse against the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), bigger problems have evolved that may never be addressed without Congressional overhaul on current legislation. There is one major problem in the FICO scoring models implemented with each major credit reporting agency ( CRAS ). The excessive use of credit checks that draw down ones credit scores, and in many cases these credit reports are run as a full inquiry that causes severe damage to a persons credit score even though there was no validation on approval to pull credit or as the FCRA states a legitimate business need. Accordingly ; I may request under my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act ( FACTA ), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) I request a full validation of each posted inquiry, proving that I indeed signed a credit authorization for each inquiry. 

DISCLOSURE : THIS IS NOT AN IDENTITY THEFT DISPUTE, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM TAKING ANY POSITION OF IDENTITY THEFT EITHER WITH ANY CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY OR ANY SUBSCRIBERE THAT PARTAKES IN THE PRIVLIDGES ON REPORTING CONSUMERS PAYMENT HISTORY, IT IS A DISPUTE ON GROUNDS OF VALIDATION PURPOSES ONLY. 

LEGAL DISPUTE ON EXCESSIVE INQUIRY PRACTICES INTO A CONSUMER REPORT WITHOUT PROPER DISCLOSURES IN PLACE AND/OR ABUSIVE EXTENSION OF LEGITIMATE BUSINESS PURPOSES, THIS IS THE ACTUAL GUIDELINES OF OBTAINING CONSUMER REPORTS UNDER THE FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT As a public service, the staff of the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) has prepared the following complete text of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.

I have opted out of my public information with XXXX, and I believe that requesting the deletion of any inquiry based on any legitimate connection to a public record vendor such as XXXX is within my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the Fair and Accurate Transactions Act ( FACTA ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). In review of the numerous hard copy disputes on my credit report, I am requesting only the proper protocol to be adhered to in order to maintain the legitimacy of the hard inquiry, that includes an actual name of the person involved with any company that pulled a hard review of my credit history, but in addition a copy of the actual report ascertained from such a review. If these items can not be produced, then by deductive reasoning the hard inquiry is not 100 % legitimate. Accordingly, under review of 604. Permissible purposes of consumer reports [ 15 U.S.C. 1681b ] ( a ), I request the deletion of the following lists of hard inquiries as follows : I demand my rights be protected based on the 2020 Edition of the Privacy Act published by the U.S. Department of Justice. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED : PLEASE INSERT A BLOCK ON MY FILE FROM ALL FUTURE PROMOTIONAL REVIEWS THE FOLLOWING ATTACHED REVIEWS OF MY CREDIT IS A DISASTER AND I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAVE AUTHORIZE SO MANY REVIEWS. I HAVE DELETED ALL APPLICATIONS. PLEASE DELETE ALL OF THE ATTACHED CREDIT REVIEWS AS THEY WOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED. PLEASE BLOCK MY CREDIT REPORT INFORMATION FROM ALL UNAUTHORIZED INQUIRIES FROM THIS POINT FORWARD : This letter is addressed to the subscriber furnishing the information on my credit reports, and if this letter is addressed to any credit reporting agency, then it is considered a ghost letter mirroring the actual request for documentation of a credit trade line I may have issues with. It is my understanding that each credit reporting agency has an obligation to maintain accuracy within the banking/credit community, and I will fulfill my obligations to work within the credit system as it was designated. 

Thank you for your full consideration in this matter.

"I have been dealing with Experian on numerous false items on my credit report and they are refusing to complete the investigation according to the information I have given them. Each time I give them the information they ask for, I get a form letter saying "" Frivolous dispute '' we will not complete, which is false. I have numerous items from XXXX on my report that are XXXX reporting as late accounts, which is false, and as public judgement s, which is also false. I contacted the Court and they told me these records are not being validated properly yet each time I get a letter from Experian, they say the investigation has resulted in the items being mine. Case in point is the name of the co-signer listed on these records. The person does not exist and the social security number does not match the name of the person listed, therefore making these records ALL false and they all should be deleted. Yet, each time I bring this to the attention of Experian, I get a form letter saying they are under NO obligation to investigate because they already did an investigation. This is complete nonsense, as they are clearly using a computer driven data drive to match only my name and information listed with a record of another person and they never investigate the co-signer information, as I told them it would clearly show these are false.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

I spoke to XXXX, who said all he could do was remove the late fee, return my payment to me and have me pay it again. I reluctantly agreed to this since he said it was the only option to make the account current without making double payments. The fact remains that the website said I had a payment due, and I paid it in good faith. Now I am stuck paying extra interest on the {$220.00} which will now post over a month later.

"Issue : Bank of America credit card payment fee distribution. I have a XXXX card with Bank of America. I have utilized the funds on the credit card three different ways.

Today I called Bank of America to find out how the interest was applied to the three different percentages - on my XXXX statement only interest is shown but not which of the rates are paid first. 

Not to my surprise I was told the lowest interest rate was applied first and then highest last. So just like in the days the largest check was paid first so all the little checks caused for fee income - now the credit card interest is using the same tactics. 

I would like to see the highest interest rate payment applied first then the next highest then the lowest interest rate. This would have the funds with the highest interest rate paid down sooner than the lowest interest rate.",Credit card or prepaid card

"Dear Sir or Madam, *1. EXETER XXXX Account XXXX Please correct this inaccurate information on my credit report. I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I immediately disputed this information with EXETER FIN and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act XXXX FCRA XXXX, the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. XXXX c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

"I bought a car from this company 6 years ago. Upon receiving the car I had to take back a few times because of maintenance issues with the car. Dealership wouldnt fix the car until I reported to the owner. Owner of the company made them fix the problem which is persist the whole time I had the car. I dealt with this problem for 5years of the loan. I was late a few times on my loan and was a great customer. Maybe, the last 5-7 months of the loan I wrecked the car. I was out of work for a bit due to the wreck of the car. I owed around XXXX of a XXXX loan and was to the end of the loan. Company was mad for me not paying the XXXX. That I owed! My plan was to pay in one payment when I received my payment for insurance. My car was reported as a charge off before 180 days of a reporting time for a charge off. I talked with someone from the company but didnt get it in writing thinking they would delete the information once paid. I was a great customer and paid my car up until the end of the loan. I only owed XXXX and I felt I was done wrong for that payment. I was stuck with a charge off on my record for 6 years now and I have been getting jacked up loans because of this treatment. This company wouldnt approve me for a new car but sent a letter 6yrs later saying Im approve for a car. The way this company treated me for XXXX I would never send a family member to them. I think the prey on people with bad credit and treat them wrong when someone falls on hard time. I didnt deserve 6years of  charge off on my account for XXXX dollars I paid. Would have been nice to Have this removed so I can move on with my life. If I would have known not to trust a company when they put charge off and say they would erase once received payment.

"Santander Bank has been unable to provide to me my loan documentation. I have been told I must have opened the account "" verbally ''. Over the years I had try fighting this, I had tried disputing late items on my credit report because I have no terms of this line of credit. I have been told that I am not able to access the line of credit because I had 2 late payments. I am told I am responsible for late fees on the account, however I still have no terms of the loan. What did I sign up for and how did I sign up for this? I have been denied access to the loan documentation on numerous occasions which shows what I had legally signed up for. I had many hour long phone calls with them. 

I have even spoken with the corporate complaint office. They said because you have made payments to the this loan I am accepting ownership of it. This comment was very off base because I am not trying to deny owing money. I am willing to pay, however, I do not know what I am legally responsible for. In other words, could they just charge me a fee of {$50000.00}? I do not know since they claim this was opened verbally. Additionally, they claim that I never needed to sign anything for them to report me to credit bureaus. They stated because they mail a disclosure they can do this, even though it is after the fact. 

The only thing I remember about this account opening was something about it being "" overdraft protection '' for a checking account I once had. I had very little money and was extremely vulnerable to things like this. Since it was "" overdraft protection '' or a "" line of credit '' I didn't know much about how it all worked and did not know they could send something monthly to credit reporting companies. 

Additionally, when making payments over the phone I was told several times I could make payments to principle and not forwards fees. Turns out these payments were applied to principle payments only for the first month due but anything beyond that minimum payment due was applied to the fees. This created additional reporting of negative items on my credit report. As a hypothetical example, I would call them on $ XX/XX/XXXX and they would say "" You own {$230.00}, {$50.00} towards principle which was due XX/XX/XXXX and {$180.00} in fees. '' I would then ask them when my next payment is due, and they would tell me "" XX/XX/XXXX you have the option to not pay the fees and just pay principle but the fees would stay ''. I would reply "" Okay, I don't want to pay the fees this time but want to make my minimum principal payment for XX/XX/XXXX and pay for the following month of XX/XX/XXXX, so {$100.00} in total ''. They would agree, take the payment over the phone. Turns out years later that the second half of the payment was always going to fees and not to the upcoming month payment. 

They have refused to help me resolve this issue. XXXX  for example, does no fact checking on the claims of the financial institutions. They take the word of them over the consumer. It is even on their website. 

Despite, them not having loan documentation which would be something that I signed and should have access to upon request, they have claimed they are not wrong for reporting me to the credit agencies. In another call, they said yeah sure we can get you your loan documents but "" it costs {$3.00} per page and it can be very long, like 150 pages according the manager. '' After that, I spoke with another phone representative who told me, "" I am very sorry about that. We will waive that fee for you. What is local branch we will fax it to them. '' I gave them a local branch, went to that branch and they gave me some ACH form that WAS NOT A LOAN DOCUMENT. 

Over the years I was always under the assumption there was nothing that I could do and had to just deal with the situation. However, recently I have decided that I will not continue to be bullied by this company.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

He explained to me that I took out a 80/20 rule loan that entitles them to be paid interest upfront on the loan. He explained that it wasn't a prepayment penalty, but the way the loan is setup. I wasn't aware of this type of predatory loan, nor was it explained to me at closing. Frustrated, I continued to make payments, later, requesting the payoff again. To my surprise, it was still over {$5000.00}. I then requested the breakdown of the loan documents. In looking at my paperwork, I was charged for several insurance policies and "" other fees '' that I did not ask for, nor was I made aware of during closing. The amount financed totaled {$5500.00}, although I was only disbursed a {$4000.00} check. I called Regional Finance to complain about them packing the loan with insurance and "" other fees '' without my knowledge or consent, neither did I receive a "" right to rescind '' disclosure or anything. I also told them that I had received a phone call from a quality control company asking me if anyone from Regional Finance asked me or made me aware that I was getting insurance on the loan. My answer to them was, "" no '' I was told by XXXX, that the employee, XXXX, who processed my loan, was no longer with the company. She also informed me that I can request, in writing, to have those insurances removed since it showed I had not used them, but it would not change my monthly payment amounts due. She stated that it would only reduce my principal. ( I never used it, because I didn't know I had it. ) I also received a letter in the mail, threating to repossess my vehicle if I did not pay the past due amounts. However, Regional Finance 's website shows different amounts due than what the branch tells me is due. I signed a document to deter 2 payments on the back end on XXXX. They moved those payments, however the online system never showed those payments pushed back, thus I would get letters from corporate office claiming that I was behind when it should have been fixed. I called to report this as well, and I was told that their online system has a glitch, and my account was XXXX of the few that show this discrepancy and that it can not be fixed. Therefore, I have no way of knowing the true amount I owe. I had to request documents asking Regional Finance to verify the debt as well as correct the online system. They sent me a statement on letterhead showing what was owed up through XXXX, but the online system still currently shows me as being late. I also got an alert on my credit report from XXXX stating that I was over 30 days late, when I am not. We are technically still in the month of XXXX. At this point, I have no idea what type of loan I got, what the true payoff is, what I actually owe, how the payments were applied, how much of it went to interest vs principal, what insurance policies was attached to the loan and etc. Now my credit report is showing that I am behind when I am not. All of their information is conflicting.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"The Consumer Protection Financial Bureau : I have been a credit card holder of XXXX XXXX XXXX ' Discover It card since XXXX. What drew me to choose and ultimately use their card is their promise of no foreign transaction fee in purchases made outside of the United States. I consider myself a well-educated consumer, closely reading specifics of any product in the enclosed marketing and card member agreement materials. 

I travelled to the XXXX of XXXX, and the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. As with any travel, one would want to use the convenience of credit card, especially those advertised with no foreign transaction fees. Most credit card companies that discloses foreign transaction fees ranges from 3-4 %. Discover ultimately uses the language of "" no foreign transaction fees ''. Upon my return to the United States, I quickly scrutinized the transactions in my card statements to see if their advertisement, their promise, lived up to its word. The transaction took about two full months to post to my statement. While this delay was expected, what caught me was the extremely high foreign conversion rate they used. the foreign exchange rate used was anywhere from 15-20 % higher that any publicly-verifiable source. 

To get a better understanding of this matter, I spoke and wrote to the Credit Card Company on several occasions. I was told that the foreign exchange rate used the exchange rate at the time of transaction as published in XXXX or XXXX XXXX. The rates as I see, led me to ultimately believe that the foreign exchange conversion rate was : first, not accurate to what was published in the market sources, and secondly included a surcharge to those rates. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a supervisor at the Credit Card company and I was told that their product adheres to its no foreign transaction fee and that foreign conversion rate would be on their website.

"As a first time home-buyer, I purchased a house, about 15 years ago, that I was renting.

"I would like to file a formal complaint and investigation against Fifth Third Bank for improperly evaluating and mismanaging all financial documents for a re-finance application that began on XX/XX/XXXX and still has not been formally resolved. I have a current, good standing, mortgage with Fifth Third Bank and excellent credit. My existing mortgage originated with MB Financial in XXXX which later was bought buy Fifth Third Bank. ( In XXXX, I had removed my ex husband from the mortgage per a divorce property settlement agreement and as I had just opened a new business, I added my father on as a co-signer to ensure my employment change would not be a problem ). 

I applied for a refinance with Fifth Third Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. I have owned my own business since XX/XX/XXXX and currently still own the company. I also applied with my child support as income ( which has been consistent for 4 years and lawfully continues for at least 8 more years ) and other income as an XXXX XXXX XXXX. I applied for the re-finance with my father as co-signer as he is currently on the mortgage and to ensure there was more than enough income on the application. He is also self-employed, owns multiple businesses for 35 years, owns a farm and owns multiple properties with no mortgages and has made in excess of XXXX yearly. 

I currently owe approximately {$190000.00} on my property at 3.875 % and the appraisal done during this process valued my home at {$470000.00}. I requested a cash-out refinance of {$90000.00} to cover home improvement repairs and to remove any remaining loans I had. I was quoted a 3.275 % with XXXX points for a 30 year fixed mortgage with the cash out bringing up my payment approximately {$75.00} extra per month. 

Self-employed individuals have much more complex financial and tax documents to understand, especially when there are multiple large scale businesses. It is a much more complex document collection and underwriting review and it is my opinion based on dealing with multiple people including managers at Fifth Third Bank, that they are not adequately educated and able to request and review the correct and complicated documents of self-employed individuals and engaged in illegal responses to me during the process. 

I still have yet to receive an official written document on Fifth Third Bank letterhead stating where my application stands however I have been called twice by an employee ( XXXX XXXX ) telling me there will be a denial. I filed an internal complaint with Fifth Third Bank after she first called in XXXX, and suddenly they started to review my application again. Her reason that time was that we did not submit the proper documents. I received email correspondence that my files were "" misplaced '' and that I was being difficult. They also did not seem to open the two large XXXX XXXX packages that were sent to them with documents a month prior. We again submitted documents and restarted the process however the woman collecting documents was not even sure what she was looking at ( XXXX XXXX ). Many documents were submitted two or three times, I was told the documents kept expiring ... when in reality, they had never requested them. The woman at the company who handled that first complaint was XXXX ( her phone XXXX ). I also tried to get help from XXXX and XXXX XXXX boss, XXXX XXXX with no solution. 

Now after re-submitting everything they asked for both signers, I was emailed by XXXX XXXX that they had everything on XX/XX/XXXX to review only to receive a letter asking for more documents on XX/XX/XXXX. Some of which were completely inaccurate documents relating to me. ( For example, they asked me for tax return from a company I don't own something named XXXX and have never heard of ; and asked for a mortgage that my father has ... he has no mortgages. In addition to another slew of new documents they hadn't asked for before. 

After I questioned every line item on the XX/XX/XXXX letter, I received a phone message from XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX stating I would be denied of an approval because my employment job has changed. It has not changed. I own the same company I own and have owned since XXXX. I then questioned why if they took my income out of the equation, that they didn't count my father 's income. I then received an email saying there were trials and tribulations with my re-finance given the complexity of the documents and that since my job had changed, they could not list any income. 

It is my belief that not only did they violate the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and not provide a written, explicit factual explanation ; but they mishandled my application from the very beginning. They did not have the expertise to request the proper documentations from the beginning, lost my files, and I feel improperly calculated my income ( because they refused to count it ) and did not properly count my father 's income ( because they don't know how to read and/or request the proper documents ). 

As I mentioned above, in XXXX when I removed my ex husband and placed my father on as my cosigner with MB Financial, I had just started a XXXX and was only 3 months in. They didn't discredit my income and were able to review all of my father 's documents properly and I received the mortgage. I purposely went with my current lender instead of shopping around this time and it was a HUGE mistake. 

I would like my entire file returned to me and my father, I would like an official letter I am rightfully owed by law with a legitimate reason for denial and I would like to officially have their team investigated for mismanagement of financial documents. They are not staffed properly to evaluate self-employed individuals.",Mortgage

I missed two payments in total between then and XX/XX/XXXX, but I thought I was back on track with repayment thanks to a new automatic withdrawal schedule. 

Then, in XX/XX/XXXX, my account was closed and I received a derogatory credit notation. When I called Chase, they said that I had been behind for several months - which I thought I took care of when I entered into the new repayment agreement. I THOUGHT that the account was brought current by doing that, but ACTUALLY, by pushing the payment out by FOUR MORE DAYS - which they TOLD ME I could do and was my original payment date for years - I put myself past due every month. If we had just made a one-time payment on that date, and then kept the XXXX  as my pay date, none of this would have happened - but instead, the person on the phone just moved ALL of my dates and didnt tell me the consequences ( and possibly didnt know them, which may be even worse ). 

I called Chase, and they moved my payment dates back to the 2nd, had me make an extra payment, and updated the status of my account to current with a partial repayment agreement. However, the account is still closed, and Im NOT in a partial repayment plan - Im paying EVERY XXXX  at a 12 % interest rate. I dont think they should be allowed to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX falsely report the repayment terms to the detriment of my credit ; Im TRYING to get back on track, and they are NOT being flexible in the face of these extraordinary times.",Credit card or prepaid card

After being laid off from XXXX jobs in a short period of time and my house in Florida losing about 65-75 % of its value, I suffered significant financial setback. I eventually had to file for bankruptcy. An American Express card was part of this bankruptcy. 

Now, 10 years after my financial setback and 5 years after my bankruptcy filing, I have rebuilt my financial life. I currently have salary income ( no more commission ) of XXXX a year plus XXXX in bonus income and another XXXX in deferred executive compensation. I have very little debt.

"On XX/XX/2018 at approximately XXXX XXXX Arizona time my vehicle was broken into and my bag along with my debit card was stolen. I was notified by my supervisor who found my vehicle with a broken window at about XXXX XXXX Arizona time. I immediately went on my Chase app to cancel that debit card but before I could find the option I received a notification that my account was overdrawn. The transaction was for {$770.00} from XXXX. I immediately called Chase, the representative cancelled the card and sent me a replacement card along with providing a credit for the {$770.00}. I also contacted the police and a police officer came out to file a police report of the incident. The report was filed by Officer XXXX Badge XXXX Squad 624, Incident # XXXX. This was at my work XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. in XXXX, AZ. I have a video of the break in that I can not attach because the file is too large but I have attached a picture of my broken window. 

I received my new debit card on XX/XX/2018. I was viewing a phone online to purchase and accidentally bought the phone which was {$860.00} and the charge made my account go negative. I immediately cancelled the order. I was emailed by Chase ( attached email from  XXXX ) asking me to confirm 4 charges. The first charge was {$860.00} at XXXX XXXX XXXX, the second one {$5.00} at XXXX XXXX, the third {$0.00} at XXXX XXXX, and the fourth {$19.00} at XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I confirmed these were charges made by me. 

Then on Friday XX/XX/2018 I received a letter from Chase stating they would be reversing the credit of {$770.00} from XXXX. I immediately called Chase,  the call was made on Friday XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX Arizona time. The representative advised me the credit would be reversed because they had contacted me and I confirmed the charge was valid. I explained to the representative that I did not confirm the {$770.00} was valid but that I did receive an email about some other charges and those were valid. The representative said that he could not find the charge for {$860.00} and that it might have been the same as the XXXX charge but was pending as {$860.00} and was completed as {$770.00}. I explained that this can not be true because the first charge was Target, in person, for {$770.00} and one debit card and the second charge was for {$860.00}, online from XXXX with a different card. He said he would send the claim to be reviewed within 3-5 business days to have the credit applied back to my account.

I called Chase again on Thursday XX/XX/2018 at XXXX XXXX Arizona time to see if the claim had been reviewed. The representative advised me that they denied the claim because I was providing them with inconsistent information. I told the representative that the information was not inconsistent and that it was two different charges. She advised me that their was nothing she could do. I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor placed me on hold and reviewed the claim information. He came back and told me he need to contact a different department, visa fraud I believe he said, to very something to help me. When he came back he said that he would be submitting the claim for a second review and I would have to wait for another 3-5 business days.

I am writing this complaint because I am not sure if I will receive the money for {$770.00} that I did not charge on my debit card and I have lost faith in Chase to do the right thing. I do live paycheck to paycheck and have bills to pay. I have already had my car insurance payment of $ XXXX returned and a returned Item fee of {$34.00} charged because of Chase 's mistake.

The first time we tried to use it, it did not work so I tried to register it online. Registering it online was unsuccessful so I called the customer servicer number. 

Customer Service said that the request to activate the card had to be in writing and could only be done by fax, ( name, address, phone number, and a photocopy of the card ) to a ( XXXX ) area code activation number and I was told that it would "" take a few days '' to activate once they had received the faxed request. 

The second time I tried to use it, again it was declined. Called customer service again and this time was told that earlier that day it had already been used and now had a zero balance. 

Once again, called customer service who advised that it may have been a 'misread ' ( I pointed out that the card had been in my possession when it was supposedly used XXXX miles away ) and advised that I should "" wait a couple of days '' and call back to see if the charge was removed. Predictably, when I called back the charge was not removed, and was actually paid out to the merchant.

Again, needed to supply all of my personal information in writing to request a dispute of the charge. When I asked how long this would take or what to expect the answer was call back in two weeks. 

Two weeks later when I call the dispute has been resolved my in my favor BUT I have to make a written request for a new card. They can not add the money to the exsisting card and will only send a card after they receive a written request via fax that includes my personal information ( this time including my email address ). 

I have been trying to fax this request repeatedly since XXXX XXXX. I have called 3 times since then and have been given a different fax number twice and non of the numbers are working. I have pages of "" failed '' status fax sends. 

This is ridiculous. The number of hurdles and barriers are far beyond the capacity of the average person to accommodate. For many, access to a computer, copier, or a fax is unrealistic, and there is no address to correspond by XXXX. 

If you search this card online it is pages and pages of "" rip-off reports '' and complaints, and the stories are all the same, the cardholder goes to use the card and just before they use, someone else has charged the balance off of it and trying to resolve it becomes a tangled maze of phone calls without resolution.

So, If a dealer wrote any fraud on application, in which I was not aware, why I should take responsibility, and If there was a fraud activity but I think only comes from both sides, bank representative and dealer, ( they made some kind deal, i only speculate with my situation, and I was not present when they made deals ).

"This XXXX had a carryover balance since approximately XX/XX/XXXX. I was making more than minimum payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I paid the full amount due on this card in the amount of {$1600.00}. When the payment cleared my bank I checked the balance on this account and it reflected {$0.00} due.
On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I called the customer service line and said I paid off this account and I do n't understand why I now have an amount due of {$12.00}. The rep said it was for "" residual interest ''. I stated I never heard of such a thing and asked for this charge to be reversed. She said she could n't do it. I called again to the customer service line today, XX/XX/XXXX and again asked why I was being charged this fee. He said it was "" easily missed '' if you did n't know about it. I explained that I have had this card since XX/XX/XXXX and carried balances before and then once paid in full I did not get hit with "" residual interest ''. Again he said it 's easily missed. I asked for it to be reversed, he said he could n't. I then asked for a supervisor. This supervisor was rude saying I was going to ruin my credit if I did n't pay it. I said it 's a "" scam '' and I refuse. If this fee is "" easily missed '' then the bank is counting on consumers just letting it go without a complaint. I 'm not willing to do that. This is a hidden fee and I do not like being taken advantage of. I told the rep I am a very good customer and it would be a shame for the bank to lose me as a customer over {$12.00}. He said it was up to me if I wanted to see my "" credit go down the tubes ''. I stated that I have other charge cards that carry a balance and once paid in full I do not get hit with hidden fees.

"To Whom It May Concern, I made my car payment on XX/XX/2021 from my mobile app but got no confirmation. The GM Financial mobile app would not allow me to take a screenshot stating "" can't take screenshot due to privacy policy ''. The morning of XX/XX/2021 I tried calling GM numerous times but was unable to get through to anyone due to high call volume. 

I then received an email on XX/XX/XXXX that my account was 30 days late. This email told me that my mobile app payment clearly did not go through. I immediately ran to my office and logged into my GM account from my computer as I did not trust the app and paid it ( again ) as it clearly did not go through from the mobile app on XX/XX/XXXX. ( I made my XXXX payment as well at this time. ) I then called GM as well on XX/XX/2021 after making the payment from my computer and spoke with a representative who assured me that it would not be recorded as a 30 day late payment. 

Today, XX/XX/2021 I was notified by logging into my XXXX  account that my credit score dropped by over 50 points and that GM did in fact record XX/XX/2021 as a 30 day late payment. 
I would like this late payment taken off of my credit report for these reasons : 1 ) I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX on the mobile app which clearly has issues and does not allow the consumer to take screenshots as proof of payment. 
2 ) I made the payment again on my computer on XX/XX/XXXX and was assured that GM does not report until the XXXX day and since the computer payment registered on XX/XX/XXXX it would not count as 30 days late. 
3 ) I was given misleading information as I spoke to GM again today on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that they record on the XXXX day and not the XXXX. If I am given bad information on what days will actually affect my credit it makes it impossible to maintain the credit score I have worked so hard to achieve.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"The Pressler law firm served me via the County Sheriff with a Writ of Execution back in XX/XX/XXXX. My life became a living XXXX because of them thereafter and until today. I had worked for XXXX for 20 years, and am well educated with the Court system and pleadings, requirements, etc. I immediately hired attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, in XXXX, NJ to represent me. Multiple writs, notices of liens, wage garnishment applications, information subpoenas were served upon me thereafter. The sheriff was unfortunately at my house weekly. The Pressler law firm harassed me with deceptive and unfair debt matters. they filed legal pleadings and numerous lawsuits attached to my name with unsubstantiated claims. I handed everything to Mr. XXXX to handle. I at one point in XXXX became so frustrated and sick of paying an attorney to represent me for me to prove the debts were not mine, I wrote to the Judge myself. Prior to XXXX of XXXX and me receiving the first writ of execution and thereafter many other harassing pleadings and letters initiated by the Pressler law firm, I had NEVER received any other pleadings or documentation from them, nor had I ever heard of them. I also never received notices from debt collectors, had negative accounts on my credit reports. In fact, I did not even own or have any credit card when I bought my house in XXXX and had to get letters from then landlord, utility companies and doctors to prove I paid my bills in order to obtain a mortgage. The Pressler law firm was relentless. They did garnish my wages, however that was found to be unjust, and the entire amounts were returned to me back then I believe in XXXX. Mr. XXXX represented me through XXXX for these matters. In each and every matter, he had told them I had obviously been a victim of identity theft/fraud and had asked and issued notices to produce documentation, to which none was produced except for a cellular bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX, the subject matter of one of the docketed cases. Up until XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX was my mobile carrier from the year cell phones were produced to XXXX. I now have XXXX service, a subsidiary of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I also had XXXX XXXX XXXX as my home security company. My attorney tried repeatedly to discuss matters, obtain documentation, etc. from Pressler law firm to no avail. They were completely uncooperative, but kept adding docketed cases to my name and info. Pressler claimed all of the matters were owed by me, and they had my information-social, date of birth, address to prove same. Well of course they did because they had also demanded I fill out an Information subpoena and I had provided such information as required by law. After time, my attorney had told me Pressler had agreed that 4 of the matters ( there were 6 at least total I believe ) were not my debts or belonged to me, and they would dismiss them. Obviously they never did, as I am attempting to sell my home and can not get a clear title without paying Pressler the amounts of liens still on my property, or if I escrow that amount at closing. I absolutely refuse, and I will not sell my house. I would rather give {$10000.00} to a stranger, charity or an attorney to finally clear my name before I give XXXX XXXX to Pressler law firm. I attempted to obtain my files from Mr. XXXX who did stopped practicing law at the end of XXXX. His previous law firm, which is nonexistent as everyone retired and a few passed away sadly. I also contacted the XXXX County Court via online in XXXX of XXXX for such documentation and have not been given anything. Pressler law firm had sent me a wage execution at that time, to which I opposed but XXXX help me somehow they are able to ruin my life again and garnish my minimal wages ( should I earn enough ( at a part-time job I have had since XXXX of XXXX at the XXXX. Please note, I never heard or received any documentation from Pressler from the end of XXXX through most of XXXX. During that time, I refinanced my home, took out a home equity loan, and nothing appeared during that process from Pressler to prevent me from doing so. I recently did my own lengthy investigation into the Pressler law firm and learned they had actually fined {$1.00} XXXX by the CFPB, as was XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to the tune of {$1.00} XXXX for their wrongful conduct with churning out numerous ( OVER XXXX ) deceptive, fraudulent matters. i STRONGLY believe and know that the matters Pressler has attached to my name, are not debts belonging to me or ones that ever did. I do not have bad credit, I never did. My name is a very common name, I stupidly completed and returned an information subpoena to Pressler, and quite frankly thereafter all XXXX broke loose and they attacked me repeatedly with pleadings, and many lawsuits to which I had no knowledge about. Pressler has never produced any statement with my signature or account activity in any of the matters to me or my previous attorney. I can not, just can not understand how so many judgments were made against me, how liens placed on my property, previously on my car and bank accounts without my receipt of any documentation whatsoever, any summons or complaint served for me to answer and no other debt related correspondence mailed to or received by me from anyone!!

"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a partner at XXXX XXXX XXXX is the former Chairperson of the, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, of the Illinois State Bar Association, allegedly, filed a foreclosure complaint on behalf of PNC Bank, NA on XX/XX/XXXX.

PNC Bank NA is fully aware that a foreclosure was allegedly filed and that I filed a counter-complaint to defend this illegal action.

PNC Bank, NA and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX similarly to XXXX XXXX  holds a lot of financial and political power.

I was deceived into thinking a foreclosure complaint was filed with the court when in truth no foreclosure was every filed.

PNC has been collecting fees from this foreclosure that was never filed continues to charge me these illegal fees.

PNC Bank, NA has committed numerous violations to the Fair Debt and Collections Practices Act as listed in the attached exhibits in addition numerous false documents have been submitted to the XXXX County Circuit Court.

I recently found out that a foreclosure was not filed in accordance to common law and the rules and regulations that are required by the state of Illinois and federal law.

That it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on behalf of PNC Bank, NA who submitted the documents pertaining to the foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXXandXX/XX/XXXX.

The law firm paid the filing fee of {$880.00} and billed it to me along with other illegal charges but they only made it appear that a foreclosure complaint had been filed with the XXXX  County Circuit Court.

There are many legal steps that have to be taken before a foreclosure complaint is filed such as follows : That as a condition precedent to initiating a foreclosure the following must be done pe

r 12 CFR 1024.41 ( f ) ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) : Servicers must engage in a single track for considering foreclosure alternatives up to the 120th day of delinquency. The foreclosure process may not commence if the borrower and servicer are engaged in a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquency. Also, prior to referral for foreclosure, the servicer must perform a formal review of the case to confirm that the borrower has been considered for a foreclosure alternative. Even after the foreclosure process has begun, servicers must continue to work with homeowners on foreclosure alternatives to ensure borrowers have additional opportunity to avoid foreclosure beyond the initial four-month period. At any rate I believe the documents I have attached will speak for themselves VIOLATION 1692e OF THE FDCPA 1. That the PNC Bank, NA is in alleged violation of the following : per 15 USC 1692e 807 False or misleading representations : A debt collector may not use any false, deceptive, or misleading representation or means in connection with the collection of any debt. Without limiting the general application of the foregoing, the following conduct is a violation of this section : ( 2 ) The false representation of -- ( A ) the character, amount, or legal status of any debt ; or ( B ) any services rendered or compensation which may be lawfully received by any debt collector for the collection of a debt. ( 4 ) The representation or implication that nonpayment of any debt will result in the arrest or imprisonment of any person or the seizure, garnishment, attachment, or sale of any property or wages of any person unless such action is lawful and the debt collector or creditor intends to take such action. ( 5 ) The threat to take any action that can not legally be taken or that is not intended to be taken. ( 6 ) The false representation or implication that a sale, referral, or other transfer of any interest in a debt shall cause the consumer to -- ( A ) lose any claim or defense to payment of the debt ; or ( B ) become subject to any practice prohibited by this subchapter. ( 7 ) The false representation or implication that the consumer committed any crime or other conduct in order to disgrace the consumer. ( 8 ) Communicating or threatening to communicate to any person credit information which is known or which should be known to be false, including the failure to communicate that a disputed debt is disputed. ( 9 ) The use or distribution of any written communication which simulates or is falsely represented to be a document authorized, issued, or approved by any court, official, or agency of the United States or any State, or which creates a false impression as to its source, authorization, or approval. ( 10 ) The use of any false representation or deceptive means to collect or attempt to collect any debt or to obtain information concerning a consumer. ( 13 ) The false representation or implication that documents are legal process. ( 15 ) The false representation or implication that documents are not legal process forms or do not require action by the consumer. 2. That the PNC Bank, NA is in alleged violation of the following : per 15 USC 1692e 807 False or misleading representations : 3.

I started the pursue mortgage workout options in XXXX of XXXX with XXXX XXXX, and still trying to find a resolution now with FAY Servicing ; with no outcome from either servicer to help me keep my home now that I am financially and healthy stable. XXXX XXXX  was working with me on loan modification and needed a few more documents and before I could send the last documents to them ; the servicing company was changed to FAY Servicing and I have been trying to work with them since. My complaint here also includes the disregard of FAY servicing when speaking to me over the phone and their unresponsiveness to my email : did not email information when requested, would call and get hanged up on. Tell me many things over the phone of why they would not work with me on a modification and then send me a denial letter with other reasons. Some things that they said was we helped you ten years ago, and you want us to help you again. FAY representatives claimed that they didnt speak to me or work with me on email and we had. The serving and customer service from FAY servicing has been belittling and made me feel less of a person. Besides that, the reasons for their denial changed every time I submitted a request ; over the past year I have been getting myself financially stable and finding ways to earn more income, renting rooms in my home, and recently moving my girlfriend in and she is helping financially as well.

Please take a look at the many denial letters of the many hardship packages I have sent in over the past year and half : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ; which have a variation of reasons. The latest reason is that the investor will not review more than one package per delinquency, and that I have reached the maximum evaluation count. How can this even make sense to use as a guideline to evaluate a borrowers hardship, when hardships are progressive and evolving ; and taking time to get financially stable takes time and getting back health even longer? I feel the investor on this loan can extend a loan modification now that I am financially stable. Also, I believe there is a violation of dual tracking throughout this whole process when the NOD filed. Not once did I receive any communication from FAY Servicing that they received my hardship package request ; and that is was complete for their review. I am supposed to receive a letter in writing informing me that the package that I sent in was either incomplete or complete, and have never received them until this date. The only document I would get, and that is sometimes, is the denial letter and most of the time I had to call in and request that it get faxed in.",Mortgage

I spoke with a Experian credit Dispute Identity Theft supervisor named XXXX in early XXXX XXXX. My concern was as a victim of I D Theft, there should be a FCRA block under sec 605B to allow victims the right to rebuild their credit. 

I had XXXX item in public records that was negative : a XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Ch. XXXX filing in my name while I was out of town working, made by my wife 's attorney as an emergency, that was dismissed the next day by a Judge who never served me any notice nor any papers to review due to the Creditor who stole our house filing fraudulent docs with the court. The Pretender Lender XXXX claimed that XXXX ( me ) had no standing to bring a Ch. XXXX ( creditor lied ) stating he was not on loan secretly foreclosed in XXXX. 

So, the Judge, having no response from me since I was not there, nor invited nor served with any complaint or motion from the Creditor, dismissed the BK Court Stay and dismissed the case! Our house was stolen the next day. We were kicked out & our records & furnishings locked up for TWO years in the hopes that we would quit on our efforts to recover the stolen home. Incredibly, I filed a complaint against XXXX XXXX with CFPB in XXXX. Then CFPB investigated and found that XXXX XXXX indeed had placed my name and my wifes name on a loan secretly. on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX admitted that my name was on the loan! .So our home recovery is ongoing, but, the Ch.XXXX was only open for one day and its dismissal sits as a reminder of our Identity theft of my identity and should be blocked under FCRA Sec. 605B. 

Experian supervisor XXXX stated I should pay a lawyer to remove filing by vacating it. That cost too much money & I was an Identity theft victim entitled to mandate Experian to block negative inaccurate items from my CR under FCRA sec 605B. Experian supervisor XXXX advised me that the cheapest way to remove the one remaining NEGATIVE item on my CR was to contact the the Data warehouse and public records manager for Experian and ask for it to be removed. XXXX promised me that if I convinced Experian 's subcontractor, XXXX, to remove this BK filing as a mistake due to I D theft or for any reason, XXXX would delete the filing under FCRA sec 605B.

Incredibly, XXXX ( another CRA ) gladly removed the Ch.XXXX public record and other items involving Identity theft from my XXXX report, but, not Experian. XXXX checked with his manager XXXX, who vetoed his promise to delete. 

So I checked with the NYAG about why CRAs violate the FCRA law.

"PayPal closer my account Ive had open for over a year & they held on to my funds for over 180 days without any options to withdrawal money that wasnt theres too hold. 
My employer lives out of state and therefore we used paypal as an easy money transferring option. Well I was a victim of identity theft years ago and have filed all proper reports with the FTC identity theft local police etc. 
My employer and I had many verified transactions back and forth but recently in XX/XX/2020, PayPal decides to freeze my account after my employer sent me my {$600.00} paycheck. Needless Im a single mother of XXXX little boys so I called to find out what the deal was. PayPal told me I needed to fix issues in another account I had never heard of! It was a fraudulent account created from the theft of my identity. So after contacting all the right paypal consumer channels I reported this newly learned account as fraud and notified them of the identity theft etc. they would not do anything. It took a month to get on the line with a supervisor whom told me if I uploaded the identity theft reports that I would be able to withdrawal my funds within 72hours. So I went the site he advised at paypal.com/ whatever and uploaded all requested documents dispute being apprehensive to provide my personal information bc of the previous theft. PayPal didnt care.. 
after 3 days I recieved an email from paypal stating my account was now closed and ny remaining funds would be held for 180 days! 
Mind you this whole process had already taken over a month & I was waiting on withdrawal if funds that were rightfully mine that were being held bc of a fraudulent account that I had no knowledge of and gave all information requested and had previously verified all transactions and paypal even verified the funds from my employer! They were messing with me and my money and have caused me a great deal of complications and hardship. There was one dispute opened at this time as well and the dispute was awarded in my favor. But if I couldnt access my own money or withdrawal it how can paypal just take money from my account or hold or freeze funds that have already been verified? My funds are still in the 180 day waiting period since my account closed in XXXX! I have yet to recieve my paycheck which is the remaining {$700.00} from my account & it is now XX/XX/2020.

My father, XXXX XXXX died on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. Before he died, he and his then wife XXXX XXXX told me what I was to receive when he died and what I was responsible for. They told me to pay the last semester of the spring of XXXX ( I personally paid {$22000.00} to XXXX and additionally I paid one other loan belonging to XXXX XXXX ). I was never informed of any additional loans. On XXXX XXXX of XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that I owed a loan for {$26000.00}.

XXXX XXXX is stating that a specific email was sent to confirm that a specific loan was approved to my XXXX address, I have no such document. From the latest email regarding this conflict, "" When an online account is created we send notifications to the borrower and cosigner at their email addresses, when correspondence or documents are available for viewing online '' ; this is generic.

Please use the same user ID and password you created for your XXXX XXXX online account.

2 ) XXXX XXXX voluntarily approved a loan document that they knew was fraudulent. 
A ) Only my name, address, SS # and an electronic signature was used to link me to this loan.

I am not and never have been married. I did not make XXXX as my salary, etc. 

3 ) I had no real established credit at the time to warrant the approval of a {$26000.00} loan. 

4 ) What criteria was used to establish a loan with XXXX XXXX? According to XXXX XXXX 's Website using "" Credit worthiness and other factors ''. I believe only my fathers information was used to determine the "" worthiness '' of this loan 's approval. 

5 ) Neither my XXXX, XXXX XXXX ( letter was sent from her ) denying the knowledge of this loan even thought she and my uncle were listed as references and neither did my father 's second wife XXXX XXXX, have any knowledge ( accorder to her ). Can they prove that they did know or was informed. 

6 ) I have no knowledge of the accompanied password and user ID used to create the loan, only ( I assume ) my father knew this information. I was able to access this "" account '' in XXXX of XXXX. I needed to call them to access this loan by giving them my SS #. If I knew about the loan, I would would have been able to access this myself online. Proving that I had no knowledge. 

7 ) A Letter ( in supporting evidence ) and address to me, was in the mail from XXXX XXXX sent to my address, however, I never saw this letter until It was in a folder given to me by XXXX XXXX as part of my father 's effects.

"Hello, After numerous personally addressed literature and emails from Citicards I applied online for the XXXX XXXX XXXX Citibank credit card in early XXXX 2015. On all the literature and emails I received, which used my name and my XXXX account number, there were dangling carrots, if you will, of the promotion of spend {$3000.00} in 3 months to receive XXXX XXXX XXXX miles. I decided to apply and was instantly approved. Since I have excellent credit I was not surprised but I was excited as I was planning some big ticket purchases which would help me achieve the promised miles amount to plan a special trip this winter. Once the card arrived I called to activate, but I was suspicious that there was no mention of the promotion. After speaking to several representatives at Citicards I was transferred to a sympathetic supervisor, XXXX, who nonetheless, still could not remedy a situation that kept getting worse. 

I am writing to the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for help and guidance to correct what has become a devastating wrong by Citicards. Not only was I told there would be no XXXX miles, there would be no miles period to my account because I did n't make the 18 month cutoff date from my previous card. Never was this explained clearly to me, the consumer, on any of the literature and emails I received. Worse yet, why was I approved for the card, for the promised promotion, if the system knew I should n't have been eligible? To make matters much worse, I now have to wait an additional 18 months from this current card ( which I immediately cancelled and hope my credit report is not damaged by Citicards egregious misleading actions ) to apply for a new one. It devastates and frustrates me that I was so misled, lied to, and deceived by Citicards and now not only do I not have what I was promised, but the situation worsens because I have to wait an additional 18 months because of this card that was activated for a minute, literally, but was applied for under dubious advertising lies. 

I ideally would like Citicards to honor the promotions they sent to me, personally addressed with my account information. All I ever want is what I am promised, what I applied for. There is a serious problem with banks if one is not only invited to apply but then approved for something that they are then deprived of. It is a gross injustice of bait and switch. No more lies and deception and tricking the consumer! At the very least, I would like Citicards to allow me to apply for the mileage card from the date of the earlier card from nearly 18 months ago, not this new, non-existent, fraudulent card they sent to me until false pretenses. 

That is the bottom line - do not punish me because of the false pretenses you establish by contacting me and approving me for this card. 

I hope the CFPB can help in this matter and I hope every consumer, of which I know there are many, can unite and bring a stop to the credit card companies ' tendency to deceive and mislead consumers. There must be more reform and only if we all raise our voices can something be done.

The cessation of these payments was necessary to replace the income lost because I had to wo give up my job and the fact that my wife is no longer XXXX, XXXX and XXXX capable of carrying out her duties and responsibilities in her capacity as a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
At the time the lender seemed quite understanding of this situation and amenable to pursuing the deed in lieu process with us. After some back and forth between us, the lender and the attorney we engaged to help us with the IRS in terms of the discharge of the tax lien on the property, we received a 30-day conditional approval for a deed in lieu offer on XX/XX/XXXX ( document attached ). 
As we knew, Final approval would be subject to satisfactory completion of the following items : An independent valuation of the property may be completed to determine fair market value of the property. A clear property title ( i.e. no other claims or liens are attached to your property, also known as subordinate liens ). Approval from the investor or mortgage insurer of your loan to proceed with the transaction, if applicable. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, we submitted to the lender and they accepted a County Assessment of the propertys value and an independent appraisal of the propertys market value as meeting the first condition for a final approval of the deed in lieu offer. On XX/XX/XXXX we received a renewed 30-day conditional approval for a deed in lieu offer from the lender ( document attached ). 

It was not until XX/XX/XXXX, after providing supplemental information to the IRS, including a second independent property appraisal referenced above, that the Service provided us with a 30- day Conditional Commitment to Discharge the Property from a Federal Tax Lien . Of course, this Discharge is subject to verification that the bank or lender has taken title to the property. At this point, the lender in the form of a relationship manager and various deed in lieu department staff, informed our attorney that our request including a Hardship Letter and the IRS conditional commitment had been forwarded to their underwriter for approval and that it should be processed in a few days. 
For the next twenty-five days, we and our lawyer had continuous communication with the lender as to the status of our request with no clear explanation as to why it was being held up other than comments from one or two staff members that a deed in lieu would never be approved if there was lien on the property. We continued to explain that in its conditional approval to discharge the lien, the IRS was committing to remove the lien once the lender took possession of the deed. 
Finally, at the end of XXXX, because we had gotten indication through our lawyer that the lenders approval of the deed in lieu was imminent and because living in the house had become unbearable for us, especially my wife who emotionally at the end of her rope, we cleaned out the house, packed up and drove across country to XXXX. Before we embarked on our trip, I notified the lender that we were vacating the house but would continue paying the electricity temporarily. The lender said they would secure, winterize and make sure the property was insured. Unfortunately, it was not until nine days after we left XXXX XXXX that the lender secured the property. 
The IRS 30 -day conditional commitment to discharge the lien ran out on XX/XX/XXXX and by the end of the month there was still no approval of a Deed in Lieu from the lender. Our attorney at the time told us that there was nothing more he could do to get the lender to respond and we were forced to hire another attorney. This attorney was successful in getting the IRS to renew their 30-day conditional commitment to discharge the lien on XX/XX/XXXX ( Document Attached ) but unsuccessful in getting the lender to respond or address our situation in any meaningful way. This lack of responsiveness and failure to resolve this matter on the part of the lender has gone on far too long and represents a tremendous and unnecessary additional burden on my wife and I as we continue with my sons loss. 
The house in XXXX XXXX remains vacant and at risk of storm damage and vandalism especially during the winter months. My wife feels she still has responsibility for the house because her name is on the mortgage and her worrying increases with every day that the lender does take the deed to the property. In our present economic state, we are never going to be able to the mortgage payments much less make up the arrears. We will never contend foreclosure procedures but why should we or the lender endure this lengthy process and continuing expenses when we are willing to turn the property over to the lender immediately. We dont know where else to turn. We need your help.",Mortgage

On XXXX/XXXX/16, I receive a call from loan depot asking me to retrieve additional loan paperwork documentation for additional income verification and income ratio documentation.

"I had to put my mortgage on forbearance for a couple of months this year, because I had lost my work. When work started again, I was struggling to keep all my finances in order and make all payments on time. I removed the forbearance from my HPFC ( home point financial ) mortgage at XXXX XXXX XXXX, as soon as I got back to work. When I had removed the forbearance, HPFC immediately increased my mortgage payment for what they said, was a deficit in escrow. This, albeit, placed a further financial burden on me, regardless I made my mortgage payment as soon as funds cleared my XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) account from the sale of a property. XXXX XXXX XXXX indicated to me that funds were available for use, and so I went ahead with my mortgage payment. When I had learned that the mortgage payment that I made to HPFC was returned on XX/XX/2020, I immediately made another payment ( on the same day ) to them for the same account to correct the error. The payment was accepted on their website, and a green message indicated "" thank you for your payment ''. I thought nothing more of it, and heard nothing about it until I received a paper envelope in my hose mail box indicating that my payment was late! I was shocked and immediately logged into my HPFC mortgage account and discovered that my 2nd payment made on XX/XX/2020 was ALSO returned, I didn't know why this would be, as I had the funds in my XXXX account to cover the payment. I called HPFC and inquired why the 2nd payment was returned and they told me that information had been entered incorrectly. I told them that I had made the payment on their website and it went through. They said that it was some type of error and the payment had not actually gone through. 
I want to do the right thing and pay my bills, I am appalled that this error would have been marked negatively on my credit score. This time of COVID is a great financial struggle for all, and I want to certainly be responsible and reasonable. I strongly feel that the error on HPFC 's part should NOT reflect negatively on my credit reports, and I am outraged at HPFC treatment of my on the phone and lack of responsibility. They had told me they tried to call me, but I have received no call from them. They did not email me, text me. They sent a paper letter in the USPS which arrived days after the 2nd payment was made.

"I was the victim of a scam as a student at XXXX University. The scam has been published all over the media. I ended up losing thousands of dollars and had my stipend, earnings, and scholarship from me. I was explaining to Navy Federal that the reason I have a late payment is because of this scam. Typically when incidents like this happen companies are willing to waive the late payment reporting. Navy Federal has refused to cooperate with me. They actually have been terrible. For 5-6 Years I have made payments on time. When I talk to their customer service all I get is this response which does not help me resolve my problem. Navy Federal should be helping trying to get this late payment removed. I was the victim of a scam and had to change my checking account information to avoid having my money taken from me as well. See below. I also did not get my bill. was also told by their collections department that I would not be reported late if I paid before sixty days. I am also writing this goodwill gesture letter. 

To Whom It May Concern : Thank you for taking the time to read this letter, and I hope your day is going well. Im writing because I noticed that my most recent credit report contains a late payment. 

I want you to know that I understand my financial obligations, and if it werent for XXXX university fraud scam Id have an excellent repayment record. I made a mistake in falling behind, but since then everything has been paid. Since then, Ive had a spotless record of on-time payments. 

Im planning to apply for auto loan and its come to my attention that the missed payment on my record could hurt my ability to qualify. I truly believe that it doesnt reflect my creditworthiness and commitment to repaying my debts. It would help me immensely if you could give me a second chance and make a goodwill adjustment to remove the late payment. 

Thank you for your consideration, and I hope youll approve my request.

"This is my second attempt to bring this issue to someones attention who honestly cares about the unfair student loan practices from both Sallie Mae & Navient. I am victim of these deceptive practices. 

My monthly payment was way too high, and my interest rate kept increasing. Navient simply would not work with me at all resulting in out of control interest rates on school loans which will be with me until and after I die! I have become a slave to this debt! 

When I ran into difficulties making payments, I was consistently offered forbearance, which allowed delayed payments for a set period of time. But under a forbearance plan, the loans continued to accumulate interest and has become a much more expensive option in the long run. At no time was I ever offered other repayment options or plans. 
As disclosed in the recent disclosures from the XXXX audit from the Department of Education, the agency noted the support of federal and state lawsuits that accuse Navient of boosting its profits by steering some borrowers into the high-cost plans without discussing options that would have been less costly in the long run. 
https : XXXX When I reached out to Navient in XXXX of this year, they offered NO options for me which would work within my financial responsibilities rather offering me a payment plan of over {$500.00} a month.

"In XXXX of 2020 I spoke with Cornerstone Home Lending, INC about my application to refinance my FHA loan with a loss mitigation program. I had financial issues along with the pandemic that made me fall behind on payments and wanted to discuss my options about how I can avoid foreclosure. That conversation in XX/XX/2020 was for the approval of my loan modification. Over the phone the agent for Cornerstone gave me several disclosures and advised me the call would be recorded in order for the approval to be finalized. Wonderful! this was exactly the turn out I was hoping for. On that date she scheduled 3 automatic payments for XXXX XXXX XXXX. These payments were a trial period which if completed successfully the loan would be reinstated and I would now resume payments in XXXX under the new terms. {$1400.00} a month for PITI. at a rate of 3.25 %. 

Fast forward to XXXX. the first payment was successfully withdrawn from my account, although they did take it out a few days later. Because they took the money a few days late I called Cornerstone to make sure no late payments would be given or that it would hurt my trial period. Keep in mind they have it set up for automatic withdrawals so it would not be my fault if they took the money out late. At this time I was notified that my loan modification was in fact not approved and that any money taken would be returned to me and that future payments will be terminated. This is when everything went south. They told me I had missing paper worked that needed to be signed, which was not what they said ON A RECORDED LINE back in XXXX when the terms had been accepted and payment arrangements had been made. I said "" fine, send me the paperwork and I will sign it ''. A week goes by and no paperwork has been sent to me, yet I still receive monthly statements from them and letters thanking me for my automatic payment. I call again to speak with someone which at this point they advise me that it is too late to sign any paperwork and they modification would now have to be reapproved. I have asked to speak with a supervisor back in XXXX XXXX & XXXX and I get the exact same response that someone will contact me 24-48 hours. Not a single phone call from any supervisor.

They gave me no notification so I could remove my remaining balance of XXXX before closing my account and just did it out of the blue. He told me that the remaining balance would be mailed to me but the address they have on file is not my current address but my old address.

I still had XXXX saved from my tax return, to help us along with every day costs, and my husband receives unemployment. Because of this and no notice, not only has all our money been taken from us, during the pandemic, whike states rates rise, he receives his unemployed payment on Monday and since this was done late Thursday, we will not have the time to open an account and have it changed over with unemployment and verified by Monday so he will miss a weeks pay and me and my family could end up homeless and after being a loyal customer, this is how I am treated? Have my money frozen and make it so I am unable to set up a new payment option in time for the next unemployment check before we have any money and live on the streets? How is this legal? How can an FDIC regulated bank be able to not give notice so someone can make arrangements and get out their money first? Why would they close an account and never give the decency to give your customer a reason or ability to fix it?

"On XX/XX/XXXX my company handled a refinance for XXXX XXXX XXXX on his XXXX County Home. At which time he had two mortgages to payoff. A first mortgage with Bank of America and a second mortgage with Bank of America. Although it was challenging we were able to get a satisfaction filed for the first mortgage. However, to date the 2nd mortgage we are struggling. I am attaching the payoff which reflects a XXXX  balance. The payoff letter however DOES NOT have anywhere the borrower is to sign to CLOSE and FREEZE the CREDIT LINE. In addition the payoff letter DOES NOT reflect a satisfaction recording fee. We sent the XXXX  balance payoff letter and requested a satisfaction of mortgage be filed. I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX with Bank of America and they NEVER responded. I then filed a complaint with the DFS on XX/XX/XXXX because I still had not heard back from them. They then responded to the DFS stating that the satisfaction of mortgage was never filed because the account was still opened and not closed. The borrower then contacted them and closed the account. He received a congratulations your loan has been paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX and to date a satisfaction of mortgage has still not been filed. I am assuming because they never collected the satisfaction recording fee. What can be done to change Bank of America 's payoff letters for their 2nd mortgages? I currently have two other files that I will have the same exact problem. They don't include a satisfaction fee EVER on their 2nd payoff letters and they NEVER have a signature line for the credit line to be closed and frozen. This is not fair to the consumer, they don't know any better and just pay off loan and figure the satisfaction will be filed. I would LOVE to see Bank of America be fined for this, so they make a change to their 2nd mortgage payoff letters. The first payoff letters DO INCLUDE a satisfaction fee. Looking forward to hearing back from you. Best regards, XXXX XXXX XXXX",Mortgage

"Given that Synchrony Bank is a major issuer of store cards and connected to various major shopping outlets like PayPal and Amazon, I found myself with approximatley 12 accounts with Synchrony Bank, which have all been open for as long as six years. 
All of the accounts have been handled exceptionally well and have been on auto payment with very low balances as compared to the established credit guidelines, which are in excess of {$14000.00} on most accounts. To ensure timely payment on the account, all have been set up on auto payment deduction for quite some time. Synchrony Bank makes it easy to request a credit guideline increase, which was done on a regular basis and they've accomodated extremely high increases on my credit accounts on a frequesnt basis. 
My problems started with Syncrhony Bank a few months ago when there was a bank error and the automatic payment processed on my Chevron Card, which caused the payment to be late. It was explained to me that this was a system glitch within Synchrony Banks system and was immediatley recified. The fee was waived, payment was defered and my auto payment began to be processed without fail for the following month or two. 

On XX/XX/2020 I learned that Synchonry Bank decided to close all of my accounts with their organization with an extremly vague response that my accounts had a high risk of non-payment and in this letter there was no reference to my credit file or the the exceptional handing of my other accounts or those with Synchrony Bank. I asked for a more detailed response with their customer service department and wasn't offered any further of a response. I believe that this is related to the most recent bank error on my Chevron account, that was supposedly fixed. 

To make matters worse, I've also recently learned that my Lowes Account, which has been on auto payment for many years was taken off for an unknown reason, which caused the account to fall past due and a late fee was assessed. Because the account is closed, it is difficult to chat with customer service online to get this situation resolved.",Credit card or prepaid card

"ABOUT MY COMPANY XXXX has been in business for over 35 years. XXXX. About 70 % of our business occurs during XXXX through XXXX and we are approaching our busy time frame. 

BACKGROUND ON THE HARASSMENT CALL Today I received a phone call from XXXX ( representing their client who is CIT Group ) located in XXXX NY asking me to expedite a payment of over {$3600.00} by the end of this week ; as of today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I now owe them about {$23000.00}. The original agreement I proposed to them on XXXX XXXX, XXXX was... 

- {$750.00} every 2 weeks thru XXXX - {$3500.00} every month XXXX thru XXXX Then I asked XXXX if I could reduce the first part of the payment from {$750.00} to a range of $ XXXX {$500.00} every 2 weeks. No one ever got back to me I have paid between {$300.00} and {$500.00} since XXXX ; they cashed all of the checks without telling me that those checks were not acceptable but by cashing the checks it led me to believe that XXXX, acting on behalf of their client, agreed to the payment plan that I was making. So I am thinking everything is fine with the payments until I get a call today that they wanted to step up the payments and need a check by this Friday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The person I spoke to, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, threatened me with legal action if I do n't sign the payment plan by the end of today Monday XXXX XXXX, XXXX. I told them how can you call me and request an immediate payment by the end of the week and no one at the collection agency mentioned this to me WHEN THEY WERE CASHING THE CHECKS. They had more than enough time to call me in XXXX and XXXX XXXX to let me know those payments were not good enough. If I had known that they were going to do this I would have changed the timing of paying my other vendor bills. I told XXXX that if she filed legal action against my company I would go out of business because my credit would be ruined and all she said was if you do n't sign the payment agreement you will be sued because her client has to be paid ; I told her she was being very rude and she said I was yelling at her. AND THEN SHE TOLD ME IF I DON '' T STOP YELLING SHE WOULD HANG UP THE PHONE ON ME AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT SHE DID. Yes I did raise my voice and I told her what would you do if you are being threatened with legal action. I also asked XXXX why ca n't she wait until XXXX to start receiving the higher payments of {$3500.00} per month and she said 60 days is too long. Originally I wanted to start paying {$3500.00} in XXXX but XXXX would be more realistic for my company - I feel very comfortable with this payment plan. 

The other issue I explained to her is that my Bank XXXX XXXX has agreed to a 6 month payment deferral on my loan used to purchase the business in XXXX XXXX. They see the value in the business and have agreed to work with me to get out of this situation. XXXX did not want to hear anything about that.

I do have a Paypal account, but use it very infrequently, maybe once a year ... maybe once every two years. I did not recognize the sum and the letter was surprising. It looked like junk mail, I'm glad I opened it. 

I went online and checked my Paypal account. The account was normal, in good status, a XXXX balance, all payments in the history tab had cleared. I assumed at that point the XXXX XXXX letter was junk, a scam, etc. I was ready to toss this piece of mail, but did a online search for "" Paypal XXXX XXXX '' and boom, a whole slew of hits popped up dated from XXXX to XXXX. Clearly this same scenario has been played time and time again for nearly a half decade ; and it continues today. 

At this point I called Paypal ( a one hour wait for every call and transfer ). The Paypal rep confirmed that my account was in good standing, saw no suspicious activity, and knew nothing of the collection letter or had any answers for me. 

I called the number on the XXXX XXXX letter. I talked with a XXXX rep. At first the  rep appeared to be helpful in solving this problem, but after a short time I felt I was being baited into saying "" yes I have used Paypal before '' and "" yes I do have a XXXX email account '' ; in this day in age it's like saying "" yes, I breathe air ''. I said I felt uncomfortable with the call and was going to hang up and did. But before I hung up I did deny knowing anything about the debt or the Paypal account used to create it. What I did get out of the conversation is that my NAME and ADDRESS were used to create a Paypal account and the fraudulent Paypal account was linked to a XXXX account ( I don't  believe my credentials were used to start the email account ). I also got the impression a bank account that was not mine or in my name was used to link to the fraudulent Paypal account. 

XX/XX/XXXX I did find time to once again call Paypal to remove my name from the debt and get some answers. After a few transfers I was able to talk to one rep in the fraud department who was able to use on of the account numbers on the XXXX XXXX letter to pull up the fraudulent account information. The rep was able to confirm what I had learned from XXXX ; which was this : Paypal allowed : 1. A second Paypal account to be created in my name with the use of two pieces of information about me : my NAME and physical ADDRESS. 
2. A new XXXX and Bank account ( not in my NAME ) were linked to the fraudulent account. 
3. The fraudulent PayPal account was then used to make one or more transactions. Then the XXXX and Bank account were then closed. 

After some Q & A with the Paypal rep, I was told the fraudulent account and debt would be escalated in the fraud department for further investigation, but that I was clearly not a part of this scam. The rep assured me that the account and debt would be cleared with XXXX ; and this process could take 3-4 weeks. I would be notified via email when the issue was resolved. 

By XX/XX/XXXX I still had not received such an email or any other communication from Paypal. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a second letter from XXXX XXXX. The body of letter stated that XXXX had received my claim of Identity Theft and had forwarded it to the original creditor ( Paypal ). The creditor responded and indicated the Identity Theft claim was not valid.

Later on XX/XX/XXXX I called Paypal again. After many hours of holding, transfers, and callbacks seeking a qualified rep who had the aptitude to understand the issue and trace down the fraudulent account, I was able to speak with someone who ( once again ) said they would escalated the account to the PayPal Collections department for another look. I did get a direct phone number for PayPal Collections ( not an easy feat ) so I will follow up with that number tomorrow. What I did find disturbing about today 's conversation with the Paypal rep, is that the fraudulent account was still active ... the rep froze it for the first time today. 

It's disturbing to me that this loophole in the Paypal system has been exploited for over a half-decade and Paypal is turning their clients who are in good standing over to debt collectors.",Debt collection

I am contesting the amount owed on our home loan. in XXXX XXXX we had our loan with XXXX. They offered us a modification on the loan to which we accepted. Signed the documents had them notarized and sent back. We began making the modified payments and thought everything was ok. However 5 months later we received a letter from XXXX stating that they denied our modification due to lack of notary seal. They sent back the original document to prove it was n't done. However the document was notarized and signed by the notary before it was sent back to them when the paperwork was due. It was not an ink stamp and was a raised seal. They then had us start all over in the process and refused to enact the already given modification. This went on for years. in XXXX of XXXX we received an intent to foreclose from XXXX and filed for chapter XXXX bankruptcy.They filed a claim stating the amount per month was {$750.00} and the arrears on the loan was $ {$25000.00}. The payments made into the loan during that time never showed either the arrear payments nor the actual monthly payment of {$750.00}. The payments were always a lot larger and the balance never came down. Payments during this tine and before the bankruptcy were credited then removed years later with no reason as to why and no notification that they were removing the payments. For example : The payment made on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX was reversed on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX never credited back and was reversed for a second time on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The original payment for the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX payment was n't credited to the account until XXXX. This has shown up on the ledger more than once. No checks bounced no payments returned to us and the balance kept going up up and away. The loan has been transferred twice now since it was with XXXX and we have been attempting to make heads or tails of it since then. When told by our current servicer ( Caliber home loans ) that they didnt have any information on the loan we needed to contact the original servicer we thought something just wasnt right as all of that information should have been sent when the loan was transferred. Caliber had misinformation on the loan as well. They stated the that loan was an adjustable rate mortgage when it is n't. We signed for a fixed rate mortgage. This has been a disaster that is now ending again in foreclosure when it should n't as we are in the beginning stages of a modification with our current servicer.,Mortgage

There was understanding that LoanFlight was a backup lender as I also was in the process of rate shopping and receiving a Loan Estimate with 3.000 % rate at another lender ( Chain 1 XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX  PST email ). Mr. XXXX acknowledges that they may be a backup ( Chain 1 XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX PST email ). Additionally, I provide a locked Loan Estimate at a lower rate of 3.000 % from another lender to Mr. XXXX the following morning ( Chain 1 XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX  PST email ). At this point, Mr. XXXX has indicated NO COST to lock with LoanFlight at 3.125 %, and I have also provided a locked Loan Estimate with a different lender at a lower rate of 3.000 %. 

XX/XX/20 - Pending charge for {$380.00} from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) shows up on my credit card account. I called Mr. XXXX ( XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX  PST ) to inquire why my card has already been charged since LoanFlight is my backup lender.

XX/XX/20 - Pending charge from XXXX posts to my credit card account.

It shouldn't have posted since I had inquired and he had followed up with XXXX on XX/XX/20. I never hear back from Mr. XXXX. 

XX/XX/20 - Receive email confirmation from XXXX that an appraisal has been completed ( Chain 2 XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX  PST email ). I immediately email Mr. XXXX asking what is going on since I had already inquired on both XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 as to why the appraisal had already been charged to my card ( Chain 2 XX/XX/20 - XXXX XXXX  PST email ).

He follows up with XXXX, who indicates the appraisal was already completed and that the 3rd party appraiser ( XXXX  ) should have contacted me to authorize the appraisal.

Additionally, this contradicts Mr. XXXX indicating on XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 that XXXX would contact me to authorize an appraisal. Per XXXX, XXXX at LoanFlight states they did not see anything regarding holding anything until the application was cancelled on XX/XX/20. This is contradicts the fact that I inquired with Mr. XXXX on both XX/XX/20 by phone call and XX/XX/20 by email and did not hear back when inquiring twice ( XX/XX/20 and XX/XX/20 ) about why the appraisal was going through when LoanFlight was a backup lender since I had a locked rate with another lender at 3.000 %.",Mortgage

In XX/XX/XXXX, they made an agreement to lower the payment, but extend the loan until XX/XX/XXXX, when my mother would have been XXXX years old! As I said, both of my parents had retired years before taking out this loan. In addition, both of them had TERRIBLE credit! Why would anyone give a loan like this to someone, under these conditions.

The ceiling in the attached garage was caving in. If XXXX XXXX  had bothered to look at the house in advance, there is no way they would have given this loan to my parents.

"Attachment for Keybank : Foreclosure Fraud Revealed : Your Mortgage Documents Are Fake! 
Thu, XX/XX/XXXX - by XXXX XXXX you know about foreclosure fraud, the mass fabrication of mortgage documents in state courts by banks attempting to foreclose on homeowners, you may have one nagging question : Why did banks have to resort to this illegal scheme? Was it just cheaper to mock up the documents than to provide the real ones? Did banks figure they simply had enough power over regulators, politicians and the courts to get away with it? ( They were probably right about that one. ) A newly unsealed lawsuit, which banks settled in XX/XX/XXXX for {$XXXX} XXXX, actually offers a different reason, providing a key answer to one of the persistent riddles of the financial crisis and its aftermath. The lawsuit states that banks resorted to fake documents because they could not legally establish true ownership of the loans when trying to foreclose. 
This reality, which banks did not contest but instead settled out of court, means that tens of millions of mortgages in America still lack a legitimate chain of ownership, with implications far into the future. And if Congress, supported by the Obama administration, goes back to the same housing finance system, with the same corrupt private entities who broke the nation 's private property system back in business packaging mortgages, then shame on all of us. 
The XX/XX/XXXX lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in both North and South Carolina, by a white-collar fraud specialist named XXXX XXXX, on behalf of the federal government, XXXX states and XXXX cities. XXXX banks, mortgage servicers and document processing companies are named in the lawsuit, including mega-banks like XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX.

A mortgage has XXXX parts : the promissory note ( the IOU from the borrower to the lender ) and the mortgage, which creates the lien on the home in case of default. During the housing bubble, banks bought loans from originators, and then ( in a process known as securitization ) enacted a series of transactions that would eventually pool thousands of mortgages into bonds, sold all over the world to public pension funds, state and municipal governments and other investors. A trustee would pool the loans and sell the securities to investors, and the investors would get an annual percentage yield on their money.XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, New York XXXX : XXXXXXXXXXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX Committee for the Seventh Judicial DistrictAttorney Grievance XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, NY XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX : ( XXXX ) XXXX : Complaint False Claim Act Violation Neglect and Fraud Upon the Court Lacking Real Party of Interest Rule 17a BY XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX Falsely claiming to be the owner/holder of the mortgage ; Predatory claims : TILA RESPAHAMPrelated claims & Breach of contract/breach of trial mod ( HAMP XXXX ) Debt collection claims ( state and federal ) Wrongful foreclosure Consumer protection statutes ( DTPA ) Dear : Grievance Committee for the Seventh Judicial District XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX are involved in fraudulently invoking the jurisdiction of the court ; IS NOT THE HOLDER OF THE NOTE NOR ANY DEED ATTACH!

"When my student loan was sold to Nelnet for servicing I was offered a lower incentive interest rate ( 4.125 % rather than 5.625 % ) for making the first 36 payments on time. I did and my interest rate was lowered in XXXX. In XXXX I began making large payments on my loan, roughly {$1000.00} per month. I was trying to pay down the principal and when I inquired to Nelnet as to the best way to do so, I was told to simply make the large payments. Because I was making large payments I would receive monthly statements from Nelnet indicating that I did not owe a monthly payment and that I was current through XX/XX/XXXX. I switched to a lower paying job in XXXX and did not make any payments. I continued to receive monthly statements until XX/XX/XXXX reflecting that I did not owe anything. I picked back up with payments in XX/XX/XXXX and received a letter that I had lost the incentive interest rate earned in XXXX and that my interest rate was being raised to 5.625 %. When I called XXXX to inquire as to why, I was told that my loan had been transferred, that XXXX had missed a payment and that it was an error. My interest rate was adjusted back down to 4.125 % for one month. In XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter stating that my interest rate was again raised. When I called Nelnet to again inquire as to why and was told that my payments were not on time. The first individual with whom I spoke stated that, although I did not owe Nelnet any money in XXXX and was sent statements reflecting as such, my interest rate was being raised because my payments were not on time in XXXX. When I asked to speak to that person 's supervisor I was told that I lost the incentive interest rate because I did not make payments in XXXX, even though Nelnet continually sent me statements that said I did not owe any money and that I did not owe a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak to that person 's supervisor, who then told me that I lost the incentive interest rate because my XX/XX/XXXX payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX and I'd made it on XX/XX/XXXX. I pulled up my online statement, which shows my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I was then told that my payment was not 'on time ' because it was too early. It was explained that this was the case even though when the money was due ( XX/XX/XXXX ) it had already been paid on XX/XX/XXXX and I did not owe anything on the "" due '' date. The Nelnet supervisor agreed that I was not ( and still am not ) delinquent on my payment and that I had never made a late payment. I asked where in writing I was notified that by making a payment too early, or making large payments throughout XXXX ( as Nelnet instructed me to do ) I would lose the lower interest rate. I was told that this is not in writing, but because it is an incentive Nelnet could simply raise my rate. The supervisor was looking further into the matter. Today I received another call from Nelnet and the individual with whom I spoke told me that I lost the incentive because my payment due XX/XX/XXXX was not paid until XX/XX/XXXX. This is now the third reason I have been given for losing my lower interest rate. Nonetheless, the individual with whom I spoke also agreed that my account is current and that my payments have not been late or too early. Regardless, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and my XX/XX/XXXX payment was not late. Nelnet could not explain why it has taken almost 2 years for it to notice this alleged late payment, but their own records show my XX/XX/XXXX payment. To summarize, Nelnet acknowledges that my account is current, I have never made a late payment and it sent me statements for over a year that reflect that I do not owe it any money. It has now given me three different reasons why my interest rate was raised, but admits that none of the justifications it has given are actually in writing anywhere. Nelnet can not give me a legal/contractual reason for raising my rate, or any factual support for doing so.",Student loan

"My request for an Income-Driven Repayment ( "" IDR '' ) plan was improperly rejected on the basis that I do not qualify as having a financial hardship, when, in fact, I clearly do. 

I am married, and our combined gross income is {$97000.00}. My payment is about to increase to {$1300.00} monthly, which is {$16000.00} yearly. In other words, my monthly payment is about to increase to 16 % of our total gross income. 

For an Income-Based Repayment ( "" IBR '' ) plan, a "" partial financial hardship '' is defined as follows : "" The annual amount due on your eligible loans, as calculated under a 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, exceeds 15 percent of the difference between your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) and 150 percent of the poverty line for your family size in the state where you live. '' The federal poverty line for a family of two ( 2 ) is $ XXXX/year. Thus, our total gross income minus 150 % of the federal poverty amount is {$72000.00}. {$97000.00} - ( $ 16,460*1.5 ) = {$72000.00}. Fifteen percent ( 15 % ) of this amount is {$10000.00}. As {$10000.00} is less than {$16000.00}, I qualify as having a partial financial hardship as defined for an IBR plan.

For a "" Pay As You Earn '' ( "" PAYE '' ) plan, a "" partial financial hardship '' is defined as follows : "" The annual amount due on your eligible loans, as calculated under a 10-year Standard Repayment Plan, exceeds 10 percent of the difference between your adjusted gross income ( AGI ) and 150 percent of the poverty line for your family size in the state where you live. '' Ten percent ( 10 % ) of {$72000.00} is {$7200.00}. As {$7200.00} is less than {$16000.00}, I qualify as having a partial financial hardship as defined for a PAYE plan. 

Since I graduated from XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I have made payments on federal loans from two ( 2 ) servicers : ( i ) XXXX ; and ( ii ) XXXX XXXX ( a.k.a. the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ). I have been on an Income-Driven Repayment ( "" IDR '' ) plan for both loans, and my monthly payments have been manageable. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice that it was time to re-certify my IDR plan. The letter from XXXX XXXX stated that, if I did not rectify my plan, my monthly payment would go up to {$1300.00} per month ( see attached letter ). 

I filled out the necessary information online. When asked whether anything regarding my income had significantly changed since I filed my XX/XX/XXXX tax return, I marked "" yes. '' Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been employed as an XXXX and have a higher income than last year, particularly since I was not employed at all for most of XX/XX/XXXX. I provided both servicers with my employment contract, my last two paycheck stubs, and my wife 's last two paycheck stubs. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my request had been received ( see attached email ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX stating that my request had been denied ( see attached email ). The email stated that a letter would be mailed to me explaining the reasons for the denial. I never received the letter. I also tried calling the phone number in the email ( the only customer service phone number for XXXX XXXX that I could find ), but there was not an option to speak to a human being, and I was played an automated message stating the exact same thing that was stated in the email ( that my request had been denied and they would send me a letter explaining why ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a customer service email to XXXX XXXX   asking for more information. I requested an explanation of why my request was denied, as I know that I do not make enough money not to qualify for the plan. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from XXXX XXXX responding to my request. The email ignored most of my questions and simply stated that I did not qualify as having a partial financial hardship, without explaining why. 

My understanding is that my monthly payment under an IDR plan would be approximately {$900.00}, and that under a PAYE plan it would be approximately {$600.00}. As the request I submitted asked that I be placed on the repayment plan with the lowest monthly payment, I can think of no reason that my monthly payment should be greater than {$600.00}. Further, this may be a high estimate, as I understand that my monthly payment should be calculated based on my "" discretionary income, '' whereas the calculations I performed used my total gross income. 

My income is a combination of salary and quarterly incentive payments, as described in the attached documentation. When I originally submitted my request to recertify my plan, I still had one ( 1 ) incentive payment left for the year XX/XX/XXXX. Thus, it was not entirely clear what my income for XX/XX/XXXX would be. However, in order not to qualify as having a partial financial hardship under the IDR plan, our combined income would need to be at least {$120000.00}. Under no reasonable interpretation of the documents that I submitted to XXXX XXXX could I be deemed to make that much. 

I believe it is absolutely clear that Studentloans.gov and/or XXXX XXXX   was in error in making these calculations. However, I have not even been provided with so much as an explanation of how or why they determined that I do not qualify. I believe I am entitled to such an explanation at the very least.",Student loan

"Beginning on XXXX XXXX XXXX, my XXXX XXXX XXXX Credit card was fraudulently charged a total of {$2900.00}. When I noticed the charges on Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called the number immediately, reported the fraud, and my card was cancelled by XXXX XXXX at that time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was issued a provisional credit from XXXX XXXX of {$2900.00}. At that time, it was cancelled out all of the fraud charges from the XXXX & XXXX. 

Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX also decided to give my account provisional credit of {$2900.00}, so I had DOUBLE plus {$1.00} the amount of credit that I should have received. I knew that this was incorrect but assumed that the double credits would be adjusted. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX realizing I had to many credits began reversing the provisional credits and removed {$2300.00} that was over credited to my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, realizing that XXXX of the provisional credits was not reversed, XXXX charged my account for the {$490.00} dollars instead of reversing the additional charge. This cause my statement to exceed the amount I should have been charged. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I reached out to XXXX XXXX stating that when the {$490.00} was added back to my account, this made my credit card bill over {$700.00}, and it should have been a maximum of {$360.00}. And I felt that something happened with my account and it was overcharging me. I was advised that my statement was correct and just to pay it. I requested all the investigation notes from the fraud to be sent to me so I could review those myself since I did not think the statement was correct. I advised that based on the Fair Credit Reporting Act it was my right to receive this information and I wanted it. I was advised that it would be sent out to me within 7-10 business days. 

I called back after the 7-10 business days and gave the same information and advised that I wanted this information. A different representative stated that my request was not completed to receive all the investigation notes and resubmitted the request. I waited the 7-10 business days again. And did NOT receive the requested information. 

I called back again and requested a supervisor, whom I told the story to again and he advised that I was wrong me requesting the investigation and XXXX XXXX was not required to send me the information that I was requesting, though I pointed out the FCRA that was not correct, but he stated that he would help me with my error. When I told him, that something happened to the reversal and I was being overcharged I just wanted my statement to be correct so I could actually pay it. He began reviewing my statements and concluded that something was wrong but would have to look into it to find out. He was having the same issue I was, where the math was not adding up. He advised he would call me back. 

I received NO call back, so I called back again. I got another supervisor that I explained everything too and got the same responses, except regarding my request to receive all the investigation notes from when the fraud happened in XXXX. I was told at that time, that there was no investigation into the fraud, which is why I did not receive the information I requested due to the fact their only information was what I provided. Wow! That made me understand why I was never mailed the information again. This manager lady stated she would review my statements to try and understand why I had a such a large discrepancy with my statements. She told me she would call me back, I said fine, but had no faith she would. But she did call back, stating that she was still looking into it. 

A couple days later, I received a call back, but I missed the call, so I called the XXXX XXXX back. I got another manager gentleman that read the notes on my account, from what I assume the lady manager who called and left me a message, that stated I was not entitled to double credits and I know other adjustments were needed. I told the man that I did NOT want double credits. Something happened from the charge of {$490.00} on XX/XX/XXXX that caused my bill to increase by a lot and I only wanted to pay what I actually owed.

"On XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to log into my Wells Fargo online account and was unable to. I received a message asking that I call customer service.

After verifying information with the rep, she set up a new username for me to use to log in. I was then transferred to another rep to change my password. The rep wasn't able to change my password on the phone, he advised I would have to go to the branch or ATM to verify my phone number. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was able to stop at an ATM to verify my phone number. I was then able to reset my password and log into my online account. Upon logging to my account I saw that my checking account was overdrawn due to transactions that had been reversed. When I talked to the online Fraud rep on the XXXX, I explained to her that I was a victim of domestic abuse and as part of the financial abuse, my ex had called the bank to dispute bill payments and money transfers made while we lived together after he got arrested for domestic abuse and ordered not to return to my home.

Wells Fargo Bank reversed the credits and debited my checking account for the total without doing any investigation or due diligence to determine if the amounts were authorized or fraudulent. 

I do have communication between my ex and I that would prove the above transactions were valid and authorized. Furthermore, his account address was the same address for the mortgage he disputed. Wells Fargo did not investigate his claim, nor did they contact me to get any information regarding the above transactions. 

As a result of this, my bank account has been withdrawn since XX/XX/XXXX and since all my bills are on auto pay, Wells Fargo has been charging me either a {$35.00} overdraft fee, or a {$35.00} NSF fee for each transaction that has been sent to them for payment. As of XX/XX/XXXX I have been hit with 15 {$35.00} fees totaling over {$520.00}! Furthermore, I have also been hit with fees from the companies whose payments were unsuccessful! 

Common sense calls for a good fraud investigator to use any initial information to find more evidence and information to support or refute a claim. It is safe to assume that when customers report a fraudulent transaction, a bank will investigate the charges before taking action. Isn't it common sense that part of the investigation would include contacting the alleged perpetrator to get their side of the story? I would think so.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

My complaint now is that they have stated they need more time to investigate this matter over a month ago and from previous experience I know they will either blow me off indefinitely or they will make up whatever they have to in order to close this case whether true or not. Thank God I have CFPB to supervise this or they would leave this complaint as unreceived, and/or resolved indefinitely!!!

"There was previous concerns regarding a mortgage that was wrongfully foreclosed on, prematurely during litigation 's with a mortgage lender, US Bank, which caused a great deal of adverse circumstances including homelessness and potential exacerbation of a traumatic condition, to whom of which Social Security XXXX was being sought. 
Social Security XXXX was also reported to the lender as a potential income source, however the period to provide all those documents was not sufficient for the lender and they proceeded with foreclosure even though the HAMP program was still investigating whether or not I qualified for their Emergency Home Owners Loan program, which the lender, also US Bank, stated I did not qualify for. 

The same lender was also competing with other companies to acquire mortgage backed securities off the notes on the mortgages, while also receiving federal funding in the form of TARP funds, and did not extend all options to several consumers, myself included & caused situations where some individuals transitioned, died, while undergoing the process of trying to redeem their homes or find recovery options. US Bank was also involved in a XXXX XXXX case to whom of which many individuals that banked with the lender as customers having checking accounts, also were defrauded via overdraft fees and Extenuating circumstances that were subtle, yet overt. An example would be the inner workings of the accounting methods which ultimately trickled upward to the investors and those in high corporate positions, while consumers and lower level employees were given ill mandates and instructions on how to receive aid to help with mortgages and negative account balances in their checking and or savings accounts. 

For the purpose of my mortgage, I previously submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to get an update regarding the matter and also submitted information to the FHA Resource Center, the Hope Hotline and various other organizations to receive help including XXXX, who helped us navigate to the EHLP program option, which the lender neglected to provide to myself and the XXXX counselors seeking help with the mortgage. 

The only option provided was a four month forbearance to come up with a great sum of funds to cover the banks losses, while also being forced into the loss mitigation process and losing the home for small things like the actual home loan or not coming up with the tax money in time and thereby violating the local ordinances and further the lender utilizing the local ordinances to get the mortgage, insurance money from PMI and also the lien being defaulted, while also getting government aid. 

Ultimately, I returned to school after a time of homelessness and eventually getting my Social Security settlement, however I submitted information to the Comptroller of Currency and Rust Consulting group to review the lender and they ultimately said the same thing the lender stated, which was that we were not eligible to recover the home. This was after being circulated numerous times through different customer service agents in different groups and companies, all pointing back to the lender. 

The initial reason for such an error was a communication error between the lender and myself during processing where a paper did not go through during the loss mitigation process for the lender to properly process the paperwork ; either by a wrong number or malfunctioning equipment error, to whom of which the lender was given additional paperwork after additional attempts from that error were made to reconcile the error and salvage the mortgage and home.

"In XX/XX/XXXX, I got divorced, lost my job, and was having a lot of trouble coming up with my monthly mortgage payment. I contacted Carrington about doing a modification, and filled out all the paperwork necessary, but was told my ex-husband would have to sign a quit claim deed in order for me to be considered without using his income. He refused to sign it, as he did n't want his name still tied to the mortgage without actually being on the deed to the house. When I told the customer service representatives this, they told me there was nothing they could do without the quit claim deed. So I was given no option but to continue to struggle with the payment amount. 

The second issue, which I am still struggling with, is that my payment on my mortgage went up XXXX XXXX without any warning. In the past when my payment has gone up, I have received a notice stating how much it was changing, when it would be effective, and gave me the option to pay the full amount up front to avoid a change in the payment amount. This time, the first notice I got was the bill for the XX/XX/XXXX payment, which was {$80.00} higher. As I was already struggling to make the payment, and increase of {$80.00} per month is not something I can afford. I called Carrington immediately and was told that upon running the escrow analysis for XX/XX/XXXX, they found that there would be a deficit due to either my taxes or home insurance going up. So, I called my insurance company. It had gone up, but no where near {$80.00} per month. Then, I called my county treasure to inquire on my taxes. They told me my taxes were actually going down, due to a homestead credit, making my taxes for XX/XX/XXXX a total of {$200.00} ( {$17.00} per month ). Then, I called Carrington to tell them this. I kept being told over and over that the escrow analysis showed that it has to go up. However, in real life, the numbers that I was getting straight from the horse 's mouth so to speak, simply did not agree. There is no way my payment should be $ XXXX/month higher. So, I called on XXXX XXXX to pay my principal and interest amount and requested that my escrow account be closed since I felt like the money I was paying in taxes and insurance would be much better managed in my hands. I got no response when I faxed in that request. Withing a week or two, I received a call from a customer service representative stating that I was past due for XX/XX/XXXX. I told her that I paid the principal and interest due to Carrington, but I was keeping the amount for taxes and insurance until I received an answer about my escrow account. She looked up some information, and told me I could n't close my escrow account because I had a government-program loan. This was the first I had heard this. Instead of paying my own bills for taxes and insurance myself ( so that I can be sure my money is going to where it should rather than just sitting in some account ) I have to send it through Carrington 's hands first. I do not like this, but whatever ; regulations are regulations. After I explained that I simply could not afford an {$80.00} per month increase, she said she would put in a request to have the difference spread over 24-48 months. I agreed to that. However, I kept getting calls from Carrington. I called back on XXXX XXXX. I spoke with a very rude customer service representative ( did not catch her name ). I explained my situation with the escrow account, and instead of trying to help, she just told me I owed money and nothing would be done until I paid it. She said the late payment had already been turned in to the credit bureau, even though I paid the money owed to Carrington on XX/XX/XXXX. Because it was n't the "" full payment amount '' it was simply impossible to apply it to my account. I told her I did not understand why, since the "" full payment amount '' includes money paid to XXXX XXXX and XXXX County ; it 's not theirs basically.",Mortgage

I have had to contact Barclays in the past on a few issue and every time I simply get a copy and paste canned answer that doesn't even answer the question. I try to allow them to give better answers and to understand the issue but it doesn't help. It's a complete waste of time to use the secure message center. For that reason, and for my protection, it seems that using the CFPB get better results. 
I purchased XXXX XXXX Season tickets this year. I made payments and everything against my card. That part is all good. The XXXX XXXX gave me the option to opt out of my season tickets because of the virus. I exercised this option. The XXXX XXXX recently refunded my account by the same means that I made the payment ( i.e. Barclays ). Because I had been making payments, I now have a credit balance on my account. The refund was for the transactions made on XX/XX/2020 and XX/XX/2020. 

I simply want the money either deposited into the account that I use to make payments or a refund check sent to me. Now, I understand that I already redeemed the rewards that were associated with these transactions. For that reason I have a negitive rewards balance of XXXX ( or {$140.00} ). My account has a credit balance of XXXX. Barclays can reduce the money owed to me by the rewards amount of {$140.00} and refund me ( either deposit into my account or a refund check ) for the amount of {$2900.00} ( {$3000.00} - {$140.00} = {$2900.00} ).

This was on Friday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I called them back after not hearing anything on Wednesday XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told my money would be posted back to my account in 2 business days. When I called back on Thursday about not seeing my next paycheck I was told that the information about the pay they took going back to my account was incorrect. I was counting on this, making promises to my bill companies and all. She said if no one contacted me in 2 business days, that meant the escalation was denied..This is a huge huge loss I can not have. I will be in the dark, my cable and car will be gone. Rushcard should not be able to make people suffer for their mistakes. i thought the extra money was the compensation rushcard was giving customers. They never said how much or when they would be doing it. I am perfectly willing to pay the money back but not like this. I am suffering a great deal. My bills were already late so now i am in desperate trouble. These people can not get away with this! I am going back to XXXX. I would have never gone back to a company knowing i took funds from them. I did not know and they never told me, just took my money. I will also lose my health insurance which i desperately need. I need help, please! 

Thank you in advance for anything that you can do.

Other than our deferral request, we have made recent timely payments to SPS of our mortgage which they have applied to the deferred balance not our current balance. They currently have our account as current under the COVID deferral program.

Ironically, XXXX has approved our home equity credit loan ( XXXX-HECL ) on our home for the amount we requested be deferred to the end of the term of that loan as a balloon payment as we were told when we applied for the deferment. Unfortunately SPS and the new investor of our primary mortgage has acted in bad faith and has played a delaying game to collect as much of our good faith payments of the deferral balance so our request amount will be XXXX  out before it can be added to the end of the term of the loan. More specifically, we complied earlier with all of their documentation request in 2021. On XX/XX/2021 they sent us specific requirements for obtaining Profit and Loss Statement for our small business. They was sent to them on XX/XX/2021 to the letter.

XXXX on XX/XX/2021 we completed with the additional break out of Other Income and provided, in Good Faith, additional information. SPS stated we should not have used "" Other Income '' as a category even though that was specified in their first request.

This was suppose to be conveyed to the Investor. To day, XX/XX/2021, SPS is now requesting we provide another 90 days Profit and Income Statement because they claim are information is outdated even though we originally complied back on XX/XX/2021. We, my wife and I, owners of the primary residence, that SPS and the investor is acting in bad faith by continuing to delay their decision knowing that we have continued to pay our mortgage in good faith.

I'm very certain that XXXXXXXX XXXX   are receiving many lawsuits due to mismanagement of files, and also misdirecting clients and forcing some clients to loose their house to foreclosure due to not understanding the the situation of the client. My complaint has been going on with XXXXXXXX XXXX for a while.

All the time through the process, they kept requesting the same documentation over and over again with no results. They claim most of the time that documents were not received or mishandled. All the time we tried contacting the bank for an update of our process, there was a different representative, not only did they not know what was going on with the case and file, but they could not even find any updates nor any documentation regarding my file. Most of the time they kept telling me that there were no current updates and that the account specialist will follow up with me regarding the file, which they never did.It is not my fault that i felt behind on my mortgage and have caused this large debt to be accrued. I have done everything in my part as they have requested, until this date no resolutions has been reached. I finally was able to execute a complete package, and have the correct income to qualify for not only my mortgage, but for the Loan Modification as well. Now, for the past Loan Modification reviews, they have denied me for the same deal. First, they keep saying my income is not enough to support a payment. How is this possible, our income is above {$4000.00} a month, our mortgage with principal is only {$1000.00}, that is not even 50 % of our monthly debt.In other instances, they deny me because they can not do a loan modification for 2 years, my last one was more than 2 years ago, but at the same time, they keep pushing the foreclosure upon my property while advising me that I can not be reviewed until at least XX/XX/XXXX. I attached copies of the last denial. 
Also, to make matters worst, the Foreclosure attorney "" rejected '' the answer I gave regarding my mortgage summons, and also withdrew the case from court as default.

You have all required documentation with updated information for a review, and you do not want to open a template for a review of a loan modification for a possible solutions, all you want is to sell my house on a foreclosure auction unless we can reinstate. If I was able to reinstate the loan, I would not be asking you for help when I really need it. I believe you have executed "" dual tracking '' on my case. If I was in the process of a Loan Modification, foreclosure should have been placed on hold until the review is completed.

They said resale value would go up & it has some tax benefits similar to owning a second home. They enticed us by telling us we will never have to pay maintenance fees again & promised things would be positively different each time things got worse. They had our IDs during the process, they offered gifts such as cruise, frees stay & discount tickets. We felt pressured & rushed when they said it's our last chance at the lowest price. We were required to attend for 2 hours. We arrived at XXXX and left at XXXX. The pressure to buy was extreme, and they would not take no for an answer. My wife and child were starving. They told us nothing but lies. I can not even believe this process is legal. We did not get to read the contract, XXXX only went over the parts that needed signature. They mentally break, physically starve & confuse you. They basically make you feel like a bad person if you do not buy the timeshare.

I called XXXX and they denied my request to cancel my contract or buyback the timeshare. During their high pressure sales pitch, XXXX XXXX addressed my concern about possible job loss. At which point, XXXX convinced us to pay an extra fee to cover unemployment. XXXX promised us XXXX would take back the timeshare if at any point we were unhappy or wanted out, even if there was a balance on the mortgage, but this never happened even we paid extra fee for it, they lied to us & we were simply defrauded by them. During the same phone call, after refusing to cancel our contract, I inquired about how the unemployment process works since I paid for that option, I was never given assistance for it, they were very unsympathetic & told me to go read my contract. We are a 1-income family, & the loss of that job is stressful for any family.

"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX XXXX, Ca XXXX Collection Consultants of CA Address : City/ State/ Zip : Date : XX/XX/XXXX XXXX : Acct # XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I have previously sent you a request to validate my debt under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and all I received was an itemized list of the alleged charges you claim I owe you. This does not meet the Federal Trade Commissions guidelines of what constitutes proper debt validation In addition, in the case of XXXX Vs. XXXX ( IN THE COURT OF APPEALS OF INDIANA, No. XXXX ), the court ruled that : XXXX XXXX. XXXX ( b ) ( emphasis added ). On XX/XX/XXXX, nineteen days after the date of XXXX debt collection letter, XXXX counsel XXXX sent XXXX a letter declaring that XXXX disputes your debt collection-related allegations, denies the same, and demands strict proof and verification thereof. Record at 21. As such, XXXX should have ceased his debt collection efforts immediately upon receiving that letter. Instead, XXXX proceeded to obtain a default judgment against XXXX on the debt collection claim before he had mailed XXXX the necessary verification and, thus, violated 15 U.S.C.  1692g ( b ). 

XXXX maintains, however, that there was no violation of the FDCPA because he sent adequate verification of the debt [ to XXXX ] in the XX/XX/XXXX notice of claim. Brief of XXXX at 13. Specifically, XXXX claims that a copy of the consumer credit contract between XXXX and XXXX XXXX attached to the notice of claim provided sufficient verification of the debt within the meaning of 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ). We can not agree. 

The contract in no way provides sufficient verification of the debt. A review of the document reveals that it identifies only the terms of XXXX loan, including a 17.99 % annual interest rate and the original loan amount of {$2500.00}. The loan agreement contains no accounting of any payments made by XXXX, the dates on which those payments were made, the interest which had accrued, or any late fees which had been assessed once XXXX stopped making the required payments. Indeed, the existing unpaid contract balance at the time XXXX sent the debt collection notice was at least {$350.00} more than the original loan amount. Therefore, XXXX violated 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ) when he failed to cease collection of the debt by obtaining a default judgment against XXXX after XXXX had notified XXXX in writing that he was disputing the debt but before XXXX had mailed verification of the debt to XXXX. We reverse the trial courts entry of summary judgment in favor of XXXX on this issue. 

I notice that you are still reporting this collection on my credit report, which is considered to be a collection activity. You are now in violation of the FCPDA, and are now subject to fines of {$1000.00}, plus actual damages and attorneys fees, which I may collect from you by filing a claim in small claims court. These collections on my credit report are causing me severe problems in trying to purchase a home and the damage could lead into the $ XXXX. 

You should also be aware that reporting such invalidated information to major credit bureaus might constitute defamation of character, as the negative marks on my credit report harm my credit and prevent me from enjoying all the benefits of good credit. In addition, the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) does not allow the inaccurate reporting of information on my credit report and under this act. Therefore, if you do not immediately remove this account from my credit report, you are subject to another {$1000.00} fine, plus punitive damages. I'm sure your legal staff will agree that non-compliance with this request could put your company in serious legal trouble with the FTC and other state or federal agencies.

"WHEN FILING BANKRUPTCY DOES NOT EQUAL A FRESH START! 

As of XX/XX/XXXX, our bankruptcy became final. Despite the downward spiral of the economy at that time, we believed we were given a fresh, new start. Little did we know that eight years later, while applying for a VA mortgage refinance ( Ref. :  # XXXX ), we would still be stuck with a remnant of a second mortgage which was specifically included with that bankruptcy. 

Turns out that XXXX XXXX XXXX, now XXXX XXXX, had insured our 2nd mortgage ( Ref. : # XXXX ), through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of NC, c/o XXXX XXXX ( Ref. : Acct. # XXXX XXXX ), who then, unknown to us, retained a lien on our homes title. So, in order to clear the lien and secure the new mortgage, we had to pay the insurer {$17000.00}. That money was originally slated for some home improvements and bill consolidation.
Here are my points : The original Fresh Start intent of this bankruptcy was totally defeated by the above activity. Plus, we would have gone to our graves while not knowing that our heirs would have to deal with this problem. How embarrassing. Now, if all of this is legal, what good is it? What purpose does it serve, except to protect only those who need it least?
I still have the paperwork and details of the above, as well as of the ignored attempts by us for a Mortgage Loan Modification in XX/XX/XXXX, while the economy and our business started really going south. ( Please note, that the original mortgage was finally modified ( Ref. : XXXX & XXXX XXXX # XXXX ) after the bankruptcy, which then avoided foreclosure. ) When I queried the reason they werent responding, I was told that the bank was so busy, that they were answering only those who were already in arrears ... which, we werent, yet. Of course, there begins the rest of the story, which lead to our filing bankruptcy and later, during better times, the story above. 

If someone in your offices can see there is a more positive resolve for us, in this {$17000.00} confiscation, Id be more than happy to supply all the necessary documents. Please, just let me know.

"I began getting repeated calls from an NRS labeled phone number ( later to be found as Nationwide Recovery System ). I do not answer calls I don't know, especially after getting my new number about 2 years ago I constantly get calls for a XXXX ( I do not know who she is ), and that's why I originally thought I was getting these calls. I eventually answered at some point in attempts to get them to quit calling and realized they were actually calling for me, but I disconnected the call because I didn't want to continue to verify more personal information past my name until I could verify they were legitimate ( I'm going through my credit paying off anything in collections so I was starting there to verify them, as I'm aware of the types of scams there are when too much information is given ). 

The issue I'm having with this company is the repeated calls, multiple times a day. When they call, usually in the morning while I'm at work so I reject them or miss them completely, and sometimes within the SAME minute they are calling me back, and I reject/miss. Then later in the day I get the same thing. Their pattern is back to back phone calls when rejected, sometimes 4 or more times a day. I do recall once or twice maybe I have answered and told them to stop calling me repeatedly that I am working - especially while I'm at work and I disconnect with them because I am so beyond irritated with the calls happening. 

I looked yesterday to see what I needed to file a complaint with CFPB, so I called NRS and gathered the information as I didn't know what it was really in matter of. The guy that answered seemed to be polite and of course doing his diligence to resolve the matter by settling for a {$300.00} something manner, which I expected him to do. I declined and gathered the information needed for CFPB, and wanted to know why they were calling me so often. He has said as of yesterday ( XX/XX/XXXX ) they haven't contacted me since XX/XX/XXXX. I told him that was a lie because I had just received calls THAT DAY and told him I get them, usually in pairs back to back, and he seemed to dismiss that fact and attempt to collect again. When I tried again, he stated they aren't supposed to call more than once a day, and I proceeded to tell him again that there was clearly an issue when I have phone call logs saying they are doing otherwise. ON THEIR RECORDED LINE HE STATED ONLY ALLOWED TO CALL ME ONCE A DAY. I declined and told him I had to discuss it over with others ( which I didn't name at this time ) and would call back to resolve. He pushed to have a set date when I would call and I kept saying I didn't know until I spoke with others, so I came back telling him since he wanted to push - I wouldn't be calling back until the complaint was resolved with the CFPB ( and attorney general office ), and he got frustrated at that point trying to talk over me and I was pretty irate at this time as his only concern was clearly to collect. I was going to just thank him for his time and hang up but he insisted on getting me to a supervisor - which I said was unnecessary but he cold transferred me to in the middle of talking to him - which working for a mortgage company we value NOT cold transferring in any situation - which NRS clearly doesn't value nor listen to anything unless you agree to pay. 

So I wait a short minute for the supervisor and he gets on the line advising he was told I was having an issue with the calls, I said yes and now I have an issue with how rude the prior agent was when I advised him I wouldn't be settling anything with them until the CFPB complaint was filed as he dismissed me and sent me to the sup. The sup stated this was their policy to transfer when there was a disagreement - I told him policy shouldn't include being absolutely rude when I was very clear when I would resolve the manner - not at this time.

The sup seemed uninterested at all in me expressing my concern of being harassed with phone calls, and the last comment he made before I hung up on him was extremely rude saying "" If you had just settled the account with the last rep we could have avoided this whole thing ( i.e. me being upset over them being UNLAWFUL ''. I am livid - and even more XXXX after being very open with them about when I'd be taking care of my collections ( as I have been working for the past 2 months to clean my credit and pay/settle my debts ), and I feel their tactics to bully me into paying only got worse when I stated the unlawful things they were doing with the phone calls and now unresolved matters - considering I work in mortgage, with CFPB actually, and am aware what my rights are!!!

"This complaint concerns my Discover 1 credit card and an unauthorized charge of {$250.00} made to a CLOSED credit card account on XX/XX/2021, and then, without informing me, was transferred to my current open Discover account. I immediately contacted Discover to dispute the charge, and they re-edited my account and supposedly stated an investigation. However, when they contacted the billing agency, they were told that the agent indeed had the CLOSED account information and the administrator mis-informed Discover that they had requested permission for use of that account for recurring charges, which was untrue. But, Discover restored the original unauthorized charge to my account balance and added interest for the period of time from the initial complaint to the next months bill. When I contacted them to dispute their action, Discover told me that I had to obtain a letter from the billing agency admitting to the unauthorized nature of the charge and they would then remove the re-instated charge and associated interest. I obtained such a letter ( attachment # 1 ) from the billing agent, who admitted that she had recently taken over billing for the association and had just assumed that authorization for recurrent billing had been obtained by the organization. Discover refused to accept a digital copy of the letter admitting the error from the Billing agency, so I had to mail it via the USPS to their Delaware offices, even though Discovers headquarters are in suburban XXXX. Since I heard nothing in response to the documentation requested, I called regularly and after many hours of being transferred to people who claimed they were not in the proper Department, many hang-ups, and hours waiting to be transferred, all the while they kept the charge and added additional interest each month during the period they were supposedly investigating. 
Finally, after more than 60 days after they received the first letter documentation, the person I finally reached who would tell me something, told me that since the biller hadnt indicated the $ amount of the unauthorized charge, my documentation was incomplete and no investigation had been done by them. Totally frustrated, I recontacted the billing agency, where the woman told me that the monies had been withdrawn by Discover in XXXX, and she provided me now with a more detailed letter about the refund to Discover and a copy of a letter from the charge processing service also stating that the monies had been refunded to Discover in mid-XXXX. By now, it is early XXXX, and Ive been charged increasing interest on the disputed charge on at least 3 monthly bills ( I continued to pay Discover the full authorized balance due each month ). These letters ( attachment 2 ) were mailed to Discover on XX/XX/2021, and I was promised a call back within 5-8 working days, but never received any communication.

When I asked to speak to someone above her who could authorize the interest refund, she hung up on me.

"There are companies preying on new homeowners, who are more vulnerable than experienced homeowners. They are searching public records to find sales, and mailing letters to the consumers. The XXXX mailings are from the Nationwide Biweekly Administration ( NBA ) and another company. There are more details below about the NBA, but the other company offered to give me copies of documents I already had for a {$100.00} fee. I believe it was either the deed or the promissory note. If I had the letter, I would give the company name. In any case, it was a scam and it is disconcerting that the CFPB is allowing these companies to continue functioning. 
I have a mortgage through a credit union, but serviced by another company. They do not offer biweekly payments through the lender or servicer, even though there is no prepayment penalty. I have been getting mail from a third party, the NBA, since we got the mortgage, offering to set up biweekly payments and demonstrating the interest savings. I read a blog at this link : XXXX, and found out that the company is a scam. My company was n't that same company, but it was just as predatory to consumers. Here is a summary of predatory actions : The word "" Administration '' in the company name makes it seem like a legitimate government entity. 
The {$1000.00} set-up fee they charge is disclosed inconspicuously on the back of the letter, in tiny print, and the complaints on the XXXX website indicate that they do n't verbally disclose the fee over the phone, when setting up the service. 
The sample calculation for the expected interest savings is not relevant to consumers. It says something like, "" This is not your interest rate or loan amount -- your actual savings may differ '' and they inflate the amount of savings being advertised by using a sample rate about 2 % higher than market rates. I do n't believe the rate applies to consumers at all, because credit scores low enough to cause rates that high would n't qualify for mortgage at all. 
They disclaim that they are n't affiliated with any lender, but do n't mention that your lender may not accept partial payments. If your lender is like mine, it says right on the statement, "" Partial payments will be held in a suspense account until the full amount is collected. '' That means, even if I send in extra payments toward my next mortgage payment, they will sit in an account with no interest savings. ( "" Principal-only '' payments are another matter -- this is about partial payments here, not extra payments. ) What 's worse : I do n't earn interest on a suspense account like I would in a savings account. 
The savings quote assumes payments are immediately applied to the loan : that is the only way to save on accruing interest. Otherwise, there is no benefit to doing this if the lender waits until the full amount is there. If the lender does n't accept the payments, then the service consumers are paying for is not being rendered and they are getting no benefit for the consideration being paid. Is n't that breach of contract? Who would set up a payment plan to only pay fees and not get any benefits? 
Companies such as the NBA do a disservice to borrowers and should not exist. This is the sort of company the CFPB should protect consumers from. The XXXX gave this company an "" A '' ranking but they defraud consumers. Read some of the comments on the XXXX website to get an idea. Even if the NBA offered a legitimate service, they charge a fee for something that would be available through the mortgage lender or the servicer for no cost. It also would n't hurt to define "" XXXX-time '' homebuyers as a legally protected class and make the fines for defrauding them extra steep just to deter this kind of predatory behavior. I have a copy of the letter available.",Mortgage

Carrington Mortgage had my escrow account to pay for taxes and insurance. They failed to pay my insurance and it lapsed in coverage. I learned about the coverage lapse when I attempted to file a claim with my own insurance company and was told that the policy had been cancelled for non payment. Carrington then force placed an insurance policy with XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have yet to resolve the issue. 

Carrington has not released approximately {$2100.00} dollars in insurance proceed despite having received all the documentation they have requested from me and despite inspection reports documenting that the home has been repaired. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX will not respond to my requests to review the damage and the repair costs despite several attempts. They hired a property insurance inspector that provided a report in which the adjuster based his findings. 

Neither the insurance company nor the adjuster will provide information as to how the inspector meets the qualifications to make the assumptions in which they based their insurance determination. 

This home had remodeling completed that was under city , county ordinances and codes. The architect and engineer where in fact  licenses. The inspector faulted the remodeling for the damage to the roof in the main home rather than the storm and he does not have the credentials to support his findings. 

This is yet another attempt by Carrington Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX to not pay a claim. I am not able to obtain my own insurance that has the coverage I need because of their mishandling. 

I am out of pocket in the excess of {$11000.00} and yet to see a reimbursement.This has caused me tremendous hardship. I can't pay my mortgage on time. I am elderly and live on a fixed income. Every time I call Carrington they ask for a document, I provide it and then I call back and they ask for another document. This has been going on for almost two years. 

Below is the letter sent to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Respectfully, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Reference Policy # XXXX Claim # XXXX Property Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX GA. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Dear Mr. XXXX, I called and left you a message two weeks ago and never received a return call. I am writing to you concerning the above mentioned claim and the handling of this claim. Allow be to provide you some details on how this policy was implemented. 
Carrington Mortgage became the new servicer to my home loan that was previously serviced by XXXX XXXX XXXX. My loan includes escrows for taxes and insurance. Carrington Mortgage failed to make payment to an insurance policy that had been in place since I bought this home in XXXX of 2008. 
Due to their breach in our mortgage agreement which requires them to pay the insurance policy, my policy was cancelled. I became aware of the cancellation when a storm impacted my home and I attempted to file a claim. 
I was advised that my insurance had lapsed. I contacted Carrington Mortgage and they force placed insurance with XXXX XXXX. The damages to my home are approaching the two-year mark. I am unable to obtain my own insurance policy due to the gross mishandling of this claim by Carrington Mortgage and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
An inspector was sent out to my home, XXXX XXXX soon months after the damage to my home. My understanding is that this inspector is not a license engineer nor a licensed architect yet you as the adjuster accepted his findings that some of the damages to my roof were a result of faulty construction to an addition to my home. 
This addition was in fact managed by a licensed engineer, a licensed architect and approved by a license state inspector and real estate general contractor. 
My home has had over {$12000.00} in repairs resulting from the storm damage, all of which are covered under this insurance policy. My home was renovated when I purchased it in 2008. 
Since then, my home has had all electrical, all plumbing and now new roof to the main home as well as the three car detached garage. 
In addition to these updates, my home has had the kitchen and all three bathrooms remodeled over the last 10 years, I have spent over {$70000.00} renovating this home. Most recently the HVAC system, yet you and the company you represent deducted for depreciation. 
I am an elderly citizen and I feel that this situation has been mishandled by your company and Carrington Mortgage. I will be contacting the state and federal agencies that oversee both the insurance and the mortgage companies involved in this matter. 
There is currently an active case regarding the lapse and mishandling of the insurance policy by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I am providing them a copy of this correspondence for their records. 
I will also be sending a copy of this letter to the Office of the Insurance and Safety Fire Commissioner, Georgia Department of Insurance, Congressman XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Senator XXXX XXXX. Enough is enough! 
I live on a fixed income. The cost of making these repairs has devastated me financially and someone has to be held accountable. 
I am requesting that the claim for the damages of my home be reviewed by your supervisor and a finding be completed in my favor to reimburse me all the expenses for the damages to both roofs of my home along with the interior damage. 
I will also be requesting compensation for the damages that would have been covered under the previous policy that lapsed because of Carrington Mortgages neglect in the handling of my escrow funds. 
To make matters worse, my husband passed away one month after the storm and this burden has taken a toll on my physical and emotional health. 
I want for you to respond to my request in writing, via my email at XXXX. This request is due to the lack of accountability of all parties involved and to ensure that there is no miscommunication pertaining to this matter. I further authorize my daughter XXXX XXXX to speak on my behalf when I am not available or able to due to my schedule and health issues.

We also lost our rental income due to the Covit-19 Pandemic. We were left in a very bad financial situation. It was hard to keep up with all our financial obligations. 
We reached out to Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing for help. We submitted a loan modification application. After six months reviewing the application, I was told that I would get an estimate trial monthly payment of {$2100.00}, with a dawn payment amount {$6500.00}.

A XXXX dollars higher than our previous monthly payments which were {$2300.00}. 
Shellpoint it is servicer with a very bad record on helping home owners. I am writing this complaint to also help other homeowners that have been harmed by Shellpoint.

Shellpoint failed to provide us with the available options for home owners, who lost rental income with the covid-19 under the New York Law, such as to have the arrears accumulated during our hardship period added to the back of our loan, with no additional interest, late fees, or penalties ; The option to assume our regular monthly payments of {$2300.00}.

We can not afford an increased of {$1000.00} in our mortgage payments. We should not be penalized for such horrible stubbing ordeal that my family had to endured.

Therefore the money I had was place on another debt account. But I will start working on paying this debt off next month. I explained that my income was limited due to a injury I sustained in an accident last year. This representative then started to get personal with asking me questions concerning what purchases did I make with this credit card? Have I been clear by my doctor, why I stopped paying this bill and so on. I began to get a bit frustrated and asked her why are you asking me these personal questions. She then stated because she was asking to get to know a little more about myself. I then told her that the questions she was asking have nothing to do with collecting money for this debt. She then went on stating that she was going to reach out to her supervisor to see what options that would be available for me to settle this debt. So I agreed to hold the line to explore my options.

"On XX/XX/XXXX I inquired on XXXX  app about a pair of shoes that were listed as Brand New with Damaged Box. I messaged their customer service team about the shoe asking what goes into your authentication into your shoes because I would hate to pay for a shoe that is not brand new. They told me rest assured we have the best authentication system for shoes. So I took a chance based on how good he said they are on authentication of the shoes. 

I believe it took about a week to come in and the exact date would be XX/XX/XXXX sorry if thats not the exact. This company clearly doesn't want me to get my money back because they change their whole app support where I cant see the previous messages they sent me unless I go in my email looking for copy of the transcript. 

But after receiving the shoes, I was excited to open the package just to see there was a big scuff mark, wear and tear, and not consistent with a brand new shoes as I own several pair of foamposite already. I took several pictures for evidence and contacted the company immediately after I open the package. Honestly I don't think the package was delivered for more than 2 hours before I contacted them about the horrible satisfaction I received. You would think the company would want to do right no they try to force me to take a store credit for a shoe that should of never been authorized as brand new from the beginning. To also point out is if this shoe wasn't confirm as authentic and brand new from the beginning I would have received my money back on my card not a store credit. This company honestly has very shady practices that hopefully you can help me put to light or even get my money back. 

I also took this issue up with the XXXX because this is horrible customer service and honestly I would never recommend anyone to use this app or deal with this company because they have been avoiding me for months. I have evidence of the shoe not being brand new and wear tear marks. 

I even had to go to the extend of contacting my bank to dispute the transaction because nobody should have to deal with customer service like this but then you go a step further and lie to my bank prolong this issue honestly I just wanted my money back but I think everyone should know of the lies this company puts out. 

1st. They have the same listing up even still till this day as the sneaker being New with defects and they fixed up some marks on the shoe. But when I purchased the shoe it was Brand New with Damaged Box. This is SHADY. 

2nd. They told my bank they offered me credit which I still don't want because look at all the hula hoops this company is putting me through for {$500.00} dollars. Its been coronavirus all year and they are trying to nickle and dime me for there errors when they could of easily just gave me a brand new pair which I did request at first. If i had a sneaker XXXX  channel like others they would replace my shoes because they did for them. This is SHADY. 

3rd. I emailed this company again, on XX/XX/XXXX since they put a credit on my account and blocked my account. Yes they blocked my account so even if I tried to even use the credit they "" so called '' offered me I was blocked from using the app for months now. I emailed them about this being blocked and they told me they would escalate my issue and will be contacted back within 48 hours maximum. As you today is XX/XX/XXXX still no reply. I even emailed them back XX/XX/XXXX still no reply. 

Please give my money back this is ridiculous and unnecessary Second, for Wells Fargo, They have allowed companies to take advantage of my rights as a consumer as this is the second company they provide no help on me obtaining my funds back and allowing a shady company like XXXX  app proceed to play with my money, still not even give me credit while wells fargo claims we have evidence they did. this is nonsense as a bank you should as your customers who have been with you for a lengthy period of time if you need more supporting evidence before you make decision they claims department is horrible. you can listen to all the calls i had with them while they were dealing with my claim. "" it looks like we have everything we need to get your money back '' "" we dealt with this before were gon na take care of it for you '' "" this is more than enough for you to win '' then all of sudden they deny my claim. this has to stop and I will no longer use a bank that allows shady business to hold my money and they do nothing about it.

"From XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX my Discover credit card has been extensively used by a scammer. I opened this card mainly for the purpose of balance transfer from another card, I set up a minimum amount to pay back every month, I barely used the card and did not pay attention to the billing statements. 

It was not until XX/XX/XXXX that I found out about the fraud amounts on this card, I contacted Discover right away and they promised me to resolve this ; within the month they returned the amounts disputed of {$250.00} back to my card, but that was not the full amount, Discover still owed me {$130.00} but I never heard from them again. 

I thought it'd be over and I could move on but no, the card was again used by scammers and charges continued to occur well into XX/XX/XXXX.

Discover later refunded me {$540.00} but the remaining amount of XXXX XXXXwas never received. 

However, in XX/XX/XXXX Discover charged me {$460.00} out of the previous disputed amounts. In XX/XX/XXXX I  disputed for the third time against the amount charged in XX/XX/XXXX with them, and they again promised to help me. 

Today is XX/XX/XXXX and I have not heard or received any response from them, I have called and followed up with the company at least 5 times. I just finished a phone call with Discover representative and was told the fraud department had completed the investigation one month ago on XX/XX/XXXX, and determined the charges were my liability. In addition, without any new information I can not open another dispute with them. However, during my previous followups nobody had told me if they made any progress in my case, and all of a sudden now they are telling me I am responsible for these charges.

"I order a Flat Iron for a XXXX present that when arrived we noticed it didn't contain the product we ordered. I contacted XXXX Customer Service, which was XXXX XXXX and was told i would get a credit until investigation was done. I then received another letter saying investigation was done, and that I had received the package, thus also receiving the product. So, I sent a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX OH XXXX. It was listed below, sent Mid XX/XX/2017. 

Hello, I ordered a Product, 2inch Flat-Iron and a Make-up Kit, online during a XXXX XXXX  sale. If there was a certain $ amount purchased, then XXXX would give you a free gift of an Electronic Wine Opener as well. Well, when they packaged arrived, everything was there except the most Expensive product, which was the 2 Flat Iron. 
I promptly called the Customer Service Number to explain that I never received this product, only to be told due to the weight of the package, it was sent. ( The weight of the package only shows Greater than 1lb ). The Free gift was heavier than 1lb, so this doesnt mean it was shipped. I think something may be going on in the XXXX warehouse, but again, thats just me guessing. However, I am 100 % positive, it wasnt in the box. They refused to do anything about it, simply telling me to notify by bank then. The purchase was made with a XXXX Credit-card, not my bank, I called them. They told me that I would need to dispute it in writing. The Investigation would take up to 30 days, then it changed to up to 60 days, later in call. I have been misinformed, mistreated, and avoided during this whole process. No one is willing to just fix the problem, which is to send me the Gift I ordered. So, I will be closing my account with XXXX immediately and any further online use with this company. I like the store, so Ill continue to visit the local store, but no more online purchases or Credit card use for me going forward. Ill return when you all act like a Professional business, clean up your trashy Customer Service Reps and fix your complete delivery process. However, this is my Official Dispute, notifying XXXX that I did not receive the product, 2 Flat Iron, only the Package containing the "" Free '' Gift. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice that they were still charging me for the "" Missing Package ''. Again, I've always said that I received the package, however it didn't contain the product i ordered. They have yet to provide me anything showing the product was in the package, other than the sales receipt that i also can print confirming the purchase of the product, not that it was in the package. 

I again, followed up with a letter explaining this again, and begging them to look into why the product wasn't in the package, not that i didn't receive the package. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, I get another Copy of the same XX/XX/XXXX letter that was sent out, only confirming that a package was signed for, not that it contained the {$140.00} Product I ordered. I even paid the remaining balance off the account and vowed never to use this company again due the way this was handled. 

Regardless of the outcome of this dispute, they have a flaw in their delivery process that they either 1. Know about don't care, which is fraud or 2.They are so negligent to this fact and won't do anything to fix it, that it makes it too risky to order from them and expect what you ordered. Then have to pay or your Credit gets affected. 

Please have them look into this issue closer and fix this mistake. Once they look into further, I think they will find a flaw in the process that would help consumers in the future also. It's too late for me, due to the time it's taken to fix this issue, when the first simple Customer Service call should have done. Thank you",Credit card or prepaid card

"In XXXX of XXXX, I opened a revolving line of credit with M & T Bank at a local branch office location in XXXX, Maryland. I provided all requisite contact information to the M & T Bank employee. The M & T Employee was XXXX XXXX. The account was officially activated on XX/XX/XXXX. The credit card was subject to a 12 month promotional offer which offered 0 % APR for the 12 month period following account activation date. I exchanged emails with XXXX XXXX and requested credit documentation for the credit card and he responded saying that no such credit documentation existed and he said that M & T Bank did not have any documentation that would allow me to understand the terms of the credit card. I opened the credit card to refinance a credit line I had with M & T Bank with principal outstanding of approximately {$2200.00}. Thus, M & T Bank initiated a transfer balance to repay obligations to the existing creditor, XXXX  XXXX XXXX, in an amount equal to {$2200.00}. This transaction was completed on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. The line of credit was advertised as having no minimum payments within the first 12 months in addition to 0 % APR without limitation during the aforementioned 12-month period which was slated to begin starting in XX/XX/XXXX and extending to the billing period ending in XX/XX/XXXX. I had relocated to my parents domicile beginning in XX/XX/XXXX and thus was not at my apartment which was the address provided to M & T for physical credit statement delivery. Nevertheless, the physical statements were delivered to my apartment located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Maryland XXXX each month up to XX/XX/XXXX. In the first week of XX/XX/XXXX, I visited my apartment to check my mail and I found numerous statements and letters from M & T Bank regarding the line of credit which I had opened in XX/XX/XXXX. The letters were hostile in nature, and i received 8 letters between XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX which stated that i was delinquent and that they were going to close the account. I was also charged late fees in addition to a balance transfer fee which i believe to be excessive. Two of the late fees were rescinded upon request and credited against the principal balance of the credit obligation. Upon reading the 8 letters, i called M & T at the number listed on the letters and submitted a check by phone for {$230.00} which was the amount currently due. I submitted a dispute with M & T Bank and received an email confirmation that the dispute was under investigation on XX/XX/XXXX. I also submitted online disputes with XXXX, XXXX  and XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX as my credit statements included derogatory information regarding my credit profile due to information submitted by M & T Bank. My credit report stated that M & T had closed my account and that i never repaid the debt that was due, which is incorrect as i did pay the balance of the account once i was aware that M & T was demanding minimum payments and my account was never closed by M & T Bank and remains open. I currently have availability under the line of credit in excess of {$1000.00} with all payments completed. Nevertheless, my disputes with all three credit reporting agencies were deemed resolved with no changes to the information on the credit report. The credit reports still show the account as being closed at the request of the creditor and the incorrect information has severely affected my credit score. At no time did M & T make a commercially reasonable effort to contact me regarding overdue payments on the Revolving Line of Credit, notwithstanding the physical statements delivered to my apartment address which represents only one ( 1 ) of the various methods of contact I had provided in good faith to M & T Bank. At the time of opening the credit account with M & T Bank in XX/XX/XXXX, I provided the following information to the relationship manager at the branch office located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Maryland XXXX : 1. Cell Phone Number : XXXX 2. Email Address : XXXX 3. Primary Home Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX  XXXX, XXXX, Maryland XXXX 4. Alternate Physical Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Maryland XXXX I have digital evidence of correspondence between myself and the relationship banker, whose name is XXXX XXXX, which was conducted via the email address listed above. Included as an exhibit to this statement is email correspondence between me and XXXX XXXX, the relationship banker at M & T Bank who was responsible for opening the new account for me in XX/XX/XXXX, which is clear evidence that my email address was readily available, therefore if my account was overdue or needed urgent attention, it would have been easy to contact me via email. I also have phone records of calls with XXXX XXXX which is evidence that my cell phone was also readily available and provided in good faith upon account opening. Despite all of this, M & T Bank submitted information to all XXXX major credit reporting agencies making a false allegation that I was delinquent and had not made minimum payments on the revolving line of credit opened in XX/XX/XXXX. There are two principal reasons I believe these allegations are false and in bad faith : 1. M & T Bank did not make clear to me at time of opening the credit card that the account would be subject to minimum monthly payments of principal during the introductory 12 month period. 2. M & T Bank did not take any actions or make a commercially reasonable effort to contact me via cell phone, alternate home address, or email, all of which were readily available and would have resulted in quick responses from me. However, M & T Bank only relied on physical mail delivery to my primary address which I was not staying at during the aforementioned three month period where Lender had accused me of defaulting on the credit obligations.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"I have student loan accounts with Navient and am also the co-signer on two of my daughter 's student loan accounts. I recently received notification that I was delinquent on my student loan account. I usually pay {$110.00} per month ( which is beyond my minimum monthly payment ) and believed this was a big error. I began searching through my previous payment history and found Navient has been misapplying my payments. They have been taking my personal payments and applying them to my daughter 's accounts, which is unacceptable. This has happened 34 different times since XX/XX/XXXX but the majority of misapplied payments have been occurring since XX/XX/XXXX. The total amount of misapplied payments is  {$3300.00} which should have been applied to my personal accounts but instead applied to my daughters. The remaining amounts that were applied to my account only went towards interest - nothing was applied to my principle balance which means my balance has not decreased in a very long time. In some situations, they didn't apply the payment to my account at all which resulted in a late fee and negative credit reporting. To ensure I did everything correctly when sending in my payments, I checked the company 's website and found disclosure on how/where to send payments. These disclosures have two pieces, one for the primary borrower and where to send the payments, and one for the cosigner and where to send the payments. I have been sending all of my payments to the primary borrower payment location as their disclosures state so there is no reason for the company to take my money and apply it to my daughter 's accounts. When I tried to call and talk to the company, their customer service representative was very rude and told me I had to "" prove '' my case. Here is all the proof they need. The company 's unfair and deceptive payment allocation practices have not only caused improper handling of my account ( which should be paid off by now due to the amount of overpayments I have made ) but have also incorrectly charged late fees and incorrectly reported me to the Credit Reporting Agencies. 

In the attached documents, you will find enough evidence to prove their wrong doing. One is my payment history I retrieved from the company 's website. The highlighted portions show late charges, my payments being applied to my daughter 's account ( her accounts are the ones with the name "" XXXX '' ),  along with proof that no principle has been paid on my account. There is one payment from XX/XX/XXXX that was made to my daughter 's account - she had just entered college and was still having active disbursements. This payment was misapplied to her account. In addition, you will find the last two years of payments to the company that my personal bank supplied me as evidence to show I truly made these payments. Lastly, I am providing the company 's payment disclosures I referred to earlier. 

I am asking for Navient to reverse and reapply all of the payments I identified within the Navient History document to correctly apply them to my account only. I also want the late fees waived and my credit reporting fixed. Lastly, I expect a refund of the overpayment, to include interest, because if they would have been applied correctly the first time, my account would be paid off by now. Lastly, I would like a transaction history reflecting all adjustments made for the life of my loan to ensure this was executed properly.",Student loan

As for Capital One, if I couldn't qualify for a 3 year-old line of credit, I shouldn't have the {$1000.00} different line of credit card. They had studied me and wanted to log me in credit card debt!

USAA explained that the deposit to XXXX could be cancelled and instead deposited in a USAA account. Both myself and a USAA agent spoke with a banker at XXXX. XXXX cancelled the deposit and reported that the check was fine to deposit at any financial institution. 
USAA raised my deposit limit and had me deposit this approximately {$12000.00} check at USAA. The agent had asked for copies of the check be uploaded where the check could be cleared manually then deposited and cashed the next day. 
I specifically asked that notes and instructions placed in my contact record so that any agent could follow the original contacts plan. 
The agent I spoke with found on my insisting checks could be manually cleared. She checked to find that it was in-fact possible to deposit manually and speed up the availability of the funds. 
The check was placed on a hold, a banker explained that the check was not manually deposited but deposited through the automated system and nothing could be changed to manual deposit since the check was already deposited with the unwanted and unnecessary 5 day hold. Had USAA not convinced me to deposit the check with them I would have had the funds available more quickly. 
I received a notice about 5 days later that the hold was removed and the funds were now available. I initially saw that the account reported that all my funds were available. I paid bills, USAA paid some automatic bills. USAA withdrew an amount equal to the deposit and reported that the check was returned.

The agent said my phone does not work with the callback system. She made no attempt to call back. My phone has proved itself with the call back system every time I have used it. When I called back and chose to remain on hold I waited over an hour without being connected with an agent. Online chat was off and when I finally requested to file a complaint. It rang through but no one answered. I tried a second time and was again transferred and placed on hold. As I waited a long time without help or response I searched the help system for the name of the government agency that requested the bank and what agency took formal complaints. There was no information I could find that would tell me the agency that handled complaints. Complaint to regulating body may have caused the system to show me a page where USAA took complaints. I had tried to find that information earlier but could not find it until I submitted questions asking what outside body I could complain to. 
I summarized in my complaint in their form and requested a call when the complaint was received. 
The bank is accruing penalties for me by removing money from my accounts and not calling me or texting me to inform me they removed money from my accounts. 
This has hurt me financially and my reputation. I have been locked out of third party services due to bounced checks. I do not know the extent of the damage and have been unable to reach a bank agent to stop sending out checks with insufficient funds. 
I believe USAA wanted my business I had with PenFed. I believe that agents who should have known these procedures created answers rather than getting the true knowledge needed from accurate resources. 
I am not certain that the problems are accidental and not sure I want to use this bank for more than the 35 years I have been a customer. 
I have actually spoken with supervisors to tell the about agents that in my opinion have performed with excellence so that they get special recognition. I rarely if ever have need to give bad reviews or complaints. On a rare occasion such as this I would expect to be taken seriously as I have given many compliments to businesses over the years. 
I hope that by contacting your office may get me assistance from the bank, return my money, and hopefully reassure me that the banks inappropriate behavior is accidental and not finding an employee using a customers assets personally during the extended clearing or holding times. 
Most importantly my complaint to the agency that regulates USAA will lead the bank to locate and return my money. I also hope this leads to the bank reporting their errors to clear me of the bad reputation they are continuing to build.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

Despite acknowledging a previous complaint outlining my request for them to cease the reporting of false current payment statuses on my accounts with them - Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank continues to provides false information to credit reporting agencies each month to reflect current payment statuses on all of my closed accounts with them and then updates the information at regular intervals to a derogatory status in order to drive the credit score down significantly prior to resetting the payment data back to no missed payments and starting the process over again to aggressively drive the score down using false reporting and cause further harm and mental and emotional distress to myself and hundreds if not thousands of other customers who they use these manipulative, harassing and abusive business practices on.

XXXX XXXX XXXX did agree to the short sale but then I was informed the 2nd mortgage had to remove it 's 2nd lien to be able to do so. There was an agreement made with XXXX XXXX to remove the lien but that we would still pay them which we have. In the process of having this drawn up XXXX XXXX XXXX transferred the mortgage to XXXX Mortgage. My attorney had tried to complete the short sale but XXXX would not communicate with our attorney. 
We had moved from the home and were over an hour away from the property. We were never notified that the house was being foreclosed on. My wife had driven by the house to try and complete the clearing of our items when she saw there was a notice pinned on the door indicating the house foreclosed. We spoke to the attorney and he said they did not reach out to him nor us and at no time did they try to communicate with us. 
I have tried to get information from XXXX and they still will not respond. I have disputed this with the bureaus and the bureaus have been no help. The way this unfolded was underhanded when we were only trying to do the right thing. 
I have requested records from XXXX payment history etc, and they will not respond.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
"This is a notice of dispute pursuant to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), section 623, subsection ( 8 ) ( D ).

I have Demanded a copy of my signature or some proof of Claim, affidavit from both copies. I received nothing back and it has been over 30days since my complaint to both companies.

The basis for my dispute is that, as I understand the code, your office was required to notify me, in writing, prior to, or no later than 30 days after furnishing any negative information to the consumer credit reporting, that such information was being furnished. This notification is required under the FCRA, section 623, subsection ( 7 ) ( A. ) I am requesting that you provide me with proof of notification, i.e. a copy of the actual notification sent, and proof that it was delivered to me in a timely manner.

If you can not provide proof of notification and date of receipt then you can not substantiate that you complied with the procedures required under the FCRA. In which case, the continued reporting of negative information to the credit reporting agencies in connection with the aforementioned accounts may constitute the reporting of false information, causing damage to my reputation andfuture credit worthiness.

To resolve this situation, I ask that you investigate this matter, and modify the accounts accordingly. I also ask that you inform the appropriate credit reporting agencies of your actions, and ask that they make the proper updates to the accounts at issue","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

I also have a client that is currently held up to enter a Purchase contract of sale, because Equifax will not lift the freeze off her account via the website or call, but she has to send delicate private info to them via regular mail to their office, ( thus putting herself more openly accessed to fraud ), for Equifax to lift her freeze.

"Synchrony Bank and XXXX  continue to allow negative report on credit report despite existing case law pertaining to an FCRA violation due to existence of 1099-C. See : Civil No. XXXX,XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, Plaintiff, v. SYNCHRONY BANK, and XXXX  XXXX XXXX , XXXX., Defendants. 

Source : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX In XXXX, Synchrony Bank issued me a 1099-C because they had cancelled the amount owing on a credit account. However Synchrony Bank continued to report negatively to XXXX  about the loan they had cancelled. Despite disputes to XXXX  regarding this matter, the negative report remains on my credit report even though I was issued a 1099-C. 

Per case law this matter was taken to federal court on the following merits by the Plaintiff whose situation matches my own : On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX issued Plaintiff a "" Cancellation of Debt '' 1099-C informational tax form. On the form, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXcause of a decision or a defined policy of the creditor to discontinue collection activity and cancel the debt. '' Synchrony submitted the 1099-C to the Internal Revenue Service ( "" IRS '' ), which generally requires the debtor to report the discharged debt as taxable income. Plaintiff alleges he paid taxes on the discharged debt.

After issuing the 1099-C to Plaintiff, Synchrony continued to report the outstanding balance to the CRAs, and thus the credit card debt remained on Plaintiff 's credit reports. On XX/XX/XXXX, Plaintiff wrote to Defendant XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( "" XXXX '' ) to dispute the accuracy of the outstanding balance. Plaintiff alleges that XXXX  notified XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXritten dispute. XXXX  replied to Plaintiff that XXXX had verified the accuracy of the information. The outstanding balance remained on Plaintiff 's credit reports. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, Plaintiff sued Synchrony for willfully or negligently violating 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( "" FCRA '' ). Plaintiff alleges that Synchrony canceled Plaintiff 's debt, and thus, Synchrony 's continued reporting of Plaintiff 's outstanding debt to the CRAs is inaccurate. Plaintiff further alleges that Synchrony failed to investigate his dispute in failing to review underlying account information and failing to contact Plaintiff or third parties. Plaintiff alleges Synchrony 's continued and erroneous reporting of an outstanding balance on his account harmed Plaintiff 's credit history and creditworthiness. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX filed a 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) motion to dismiss because it claims the furnished information was accurate, thus precluding a violation under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ). ( Doc. 13, p. 7. ) Synchrony argues that issuing a 1099-C merely charges off the account and does not discharge the underlying debt. ( Id., p. 1. ) In Plaintiff 's complaint and brief opposing the motion to dismiss, Plaintiff asserts several facts to support that the debt was in fact canceled. The 1099-C form Synchrony issued Plaintiff is itself called "" Cancellation of Debt. '' The identifiable event code Synchrony selected indicated it was the decision or policy of the creditor to discontinue collection and cancel the debt. After issuing the 1099-C, Synchrony subsequently discontinued efforts to collect the debt and stopped sending periodic account notices. 

The parties dispute whether the court should consider Plaintiff 's opposition brief because it was filed seven days late. The court finds that the late filing did not substantively delay the case or prejudice Synchrony. Furthermore, the Third Circuit has "" repeatedly stated [ its ] preference that cases be disposed of on the merits whenever practicable. '' XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX., XXXX XXXX.XXXX XXXX, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX. XXXX ). Here, by analogy, the court prefers to consider Plaintiff 's arguments rather than to disregard them on procedural grounds. Moving forward, Plaintiff 's counsel must use greater care in calendaring. Plaintiff is also warned that, in the future, filing a motion with "" uncontested '' in its title without including a certificate of concurrence will result in the motion being stricken. See M.D. Pa. L.R. 7.1. 

The motion has been fully briefed and is thus ripe for review. 

II. STANDARD OF REVIEW To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12 ( b ) ( 6 ), the plaintiff must allege "" factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. '' Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 ( XXXX ) ( citing Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 ( XXXX ) ). "" When reviewing a 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) motion, we 'accept as true all well-pled factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn from them. ' '' XXXX XXXX XXXX  by XXXX v. XXXX  XXXX  XXXX., XXXX. , -- - F. App'x -- --, XXXX WL 4187372, at *3 ( 3d Cir. XX/XX/XXXX) ( quoting Taksir v. Vanguard Grp., 903 F.3d 95, 96-97 ( 3d Cir. XX/XX/XXXX ) ). The facts alleged must be "" construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. '' In re Ins. Brokerage Antitrust Litig., 618 F.3d 300, 314 ( 3d Cir. XX/XX/XXXX ) ( internal quotations, brackets, and ellipses omitted ). But "" [ t ] he court is not required to draw unreasonable inferences '' from the facts. 5B Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure 1357 ( 3d ed. XX/XX/XXXX ).

The Third Circuit has detailed a three-step process to determine whether a complaint meets the pleading standard. Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F.3d 352 ( 3d Cir. XX/XX/XXXX ). First, the court outlines the elements a plaintiff must plead to state a claim for relief. Id. at 365. Second, the court must "" peel away those allegations that are no more than conclusions and thus not entitled to the assumption of truth. '' Id. Third, the court "" look [ s ] for well-pled factual allegations, assume [ s ] their veracity, and then 'determine [ s ] whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief. ' '' Id. ( quoting Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 ). The last step is "" a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense. '' Id. 

III. DISCUSSION "" Congress enacted the FCRA in XXXX to ensure fair and accurate credit reporting, promote efficiency in the banking system, and protect consumer privacy. In doing so, Congress sought to preserve the consumer 's privacy in the information maintained by consumer reporting agencies. '' Gelman v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 583 F.3d 187, 191 ( 3d Cir. XXXX ) ( internal quotation marks omitted ). Once notified of a dispute, a furnisher of credit information has statutory duties, inter alia, to investigate the disputed information and to correct information found to be inaccurate. 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ( 1 ). To establish a violation [ u ] nder the statutory framework and clear language of the statute, therefore, a consumer must first alert the credit reporting agency that reported the allegedly erroneous information of a dispute. It is then up to the reporting agency to inform the furnisher of information that there has been a dispute, thereby triggering the furnisher 's duty to investigate. It is only when the furnisher fails to undertake a reasonable investigation following such notice that it may become liable to a private litigant under 1681s-2 ( b ).

SimmsParris v. Countrywide Fin. Corp., 652 F.3d 355, 359 ( 3d Cir. XXXX ). 
Reasonableness of the investigation is determined based on a balancing of "" the potential harm from inaccuracy against the burden of safeguarding against such inaccuracy. '' XXXX v. XXXX  XXXX., 744 F.3d 853, 865 ( 3d Cir. XXXX ) ( internal citation omitted ). Regarding the requirement of "" accurate '' information, "" even if the information is technically correct, it may nonetheless be inaccurate if, through omission, it creates a materially misleading impression. '' Id. ( internal quotation marks and brackets omitted ). To survive this motion to dismiss, Plaintiff must plausibly allege "" ( 1 ) that he notified a credit reporting agency of the dispute under 1681i, ( 2 ) that the credit reporting agency notified the party who furnished the information under 1681i ( a ) ( 2 ), and ( 3 ) that the party who furnished the information failed to investigate or rectify the disputed charge .... '' XXXX  v. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX., 815 F. Supp. 2d 856, 863-64 ( E.D. Pa. XXXX ) ( internal citation and brackets omitted ).

Here, Synchrony does not argue that Plaintiff failed to plead any of the required elements. Rather, Synchrony argues that Plaintiff 's claim can not succeed unless the information was in fact inaccurate or materially misleading. See Chiang v. Verizon New England , Inc., 595 F.3d 26, 38 ( 1st Cir. XXXX ) ( holding that a plaintiff must show "" actual inaccuracy '' to establish a claim against a furnisher of credit information under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) ). Synchrony claims its report was accurate and that it did not cancel Plaintiff 's debt by issuing the 1099-C. Synchrony argues that issuance of the 1099-C does not, as a matter of law, discharge the underlying debt. ( Doc. 13, p. 4. ) The parties cite non-binding and conflicting case law regarding the legal import of issuing a 1099-C. Synchrony cites cases holding that the issuance and filing of a 1099-C does not legally extinguish the underlying debt. See e.g., In re Zilka, 407 B.R. 684, 689 XXXX XXXX XXXX. Pa. XXXX ) ; XXXX  v. XXXX, 67 F. App'x 253, 2003 WL 21196200, at *3 ( 5th Cir. XX/XX/XXXX ) ; Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. XXXX, No. 1:11-CV-72, 2012 WL 1098619, at *7 ( W.D.N.C. XX/XX/XXXX ) ; United States v. Reed, No. 3:09-CV-210, XXXX WL 3656001, at *2-3 ( E.D. Tenn. XX/XX/XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. , XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ). Still other courts found that the mere issuance of the XXXX form does not constitute a legal admission that the debt was canceled. See XXXXi v. XXXX XXXX XXXX of Pa., 135 A.3d 616, 621 ( Pa. Super. Ct. XXXX ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). 

Supporting Synchrony 's position, the plain language of the applicable IRS regulation states that a creditor may be obligated to file a 1099-C even if the creditor did not in fact discharge the debt. On the form, the creditor must select an "" identifiable event, '' the date of which becomes the effective date for the discharge of indebtedness for purposes of the informational report. 26 C.F.R. 1.6050P-1 ( b ). The IRS issued guidance to clarify that the IRS "" does not view the 1099-C as an admission by the creditor that it has discharged the debt and can no longer pursue collection. '' I.R.S. Info. Letter, XXXX ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). 


Courts disagree whether the issuance of a 1099-C should be considered prima facie evidence that a loan was in fact canceled. See In re XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( holding that issuance of the 1099-C should "" not be considered prima facie evidence that the loan was cancelled '' ) ; XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) ( holding that issuance of the 1099-C after debt was written off is prima facie evidence that debt had been discharged by creditor and is sufficient to create an issue of fact ). 

Other courts have held that it would be inequitable for creditors to continue to hold debtors liable for the debt, given the tax consequences of the 1099-C. See e.g., In re Crosby , 261 BR 470, 474 ( Bankr. D. Kan. XXXX  ). The 1099-C issuance negatively impacts debtors because they must generally report the debt discharge as income. See Franklin Credit Mgmt. Corp. v. Nicholas, No. CV980546721S, 2001 WL 893894, *3 ( Conn. Super. Ct. XX/XX/XXXX ). This matter of equity is raised in this case where Plaintiff alleged paying taxes on the cancelled debt.

Significantly, none of the cases held that it was appropriate for a court to dismiss a consumer 's claim at the pleading stage on the basis that the 1099-C did not discharge the debt as a matter of law. In fact, after holding that the 1099-C should not be prima facie evidence the loan was canceled, the court in In re Washington stated that it must instead look to the entire record to determine if the creditor canceled the debt. In re Washington, 581 B.R. at 157. In the pleading stage of the present case, Plaintiff need not prove but merely plead plausibly that the report was in fact inaccurate and that Synchrony failed to reasonably investigate the written dispute of the report 's accuracy and to correct inaccuracies, as required under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ). 

The XX/XX/XXXX of Kentucky in Johnson v. Branch Banking & Trust Co. arrived at a similar conclusion in denying a motion to dismiss raised by creditor bank where plaintiff consumers brought a 1681s-2 ( b ) claim. No. 3:18-CV-150, 2018 WL 4492478, *2 ( W.D. Ky. XX/XX/XXXX ). The Johnson parties argued whether the 1099-C canceled the debt, but the court found it unnecessary to adopt either opposing view of the form 's effect, since at the motion to dismiss stage, the court analyzes the plausibility of the pleadings rather than the weight of the evidence. Id. at *2-3. Even though the issuance of the 1099-C standing alone does not prove that the debt was discharged as a matter of law, the debt in fact may have been discharged.

Here, Plaintiff pleaded several facts that reasonably permit an inference that the debt was in fact discharged : the name of the issued "" Cancellation of Debt '' 1099-C form, the identifiable event code selected on the form, and the creditor 's activities regarding collection efforts and periodic account notices. Whether the debt was canceled is a factual, context-specific inquiry. Thus, the fact that the 1099-C does not cancel debt as a matter of law is an improper basis for a 12 ( b ) ( 6 ) disposition. Taking the allegations in the complaint to be true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, the court finds that Plaintiff has plausibly pleaded that Synchrony failed to reasonably investigate and rectify the disputed balance. IV. CONCLUSION Plaintiff stated an FCRA claim under 15 U.S.C. 1681s-2 ( b ) that is plausible on its face. The court therefore denies Synchrony 's motion to dismiss. An appropriate order shall follow.

However, I did notice in XXXX of XXXX that the {$30000.00} was still included on my monthly statement. I spoke with the local branch manager, XXXX XXXX, who made phone calls on my behalf, said that there was some type of late fee which equaled {$15.00} and she would pay it out of the bank kitty. So done, I was thrilled, and she congratulated me! However, the amount never did come off of the statement. I was busy with work committments, job change and other life issues. Approximately one year later though, in XXXX, I did try to contact XXXX again. XXXX was now at another branch and it was difficult to reach her. However, I finally did, she 'sort of ' remembered but when I asked her to look into my account she wasn't able to assure me that, in fact, everything was paid as I had previously understood. This is when I originally made my complaint after speaking the State of New Hampshire who directed me to you. Please note the attached documents. I have included the initial statement from XX/XX/XXXX when the HELOC was granted ; the letter anouncing the loan amount in XXXX ; a statement from the folllowing month where you can see that now the {$30000.00} has been deducted from the initial HELOC amount of {$50000.00} ; later statements also show that those monies were always considered "" spent '' and never part of my available balance. I have also attached the letter that I received from TDBank in XXXX as a reply to my CFPB complaint. What I don't understand is that in the letter it seems that the person is stating that somehow as I paid the {$30000.00} off the monies became available to me again in the HELOC ( or the {$200000.00}. This doesn't quite ring true to me. Since I know that when I would look at the HELOC I can remember only having perhaps, {$100.00} or some smalll amounts available and this would be basically available when I paid the monthly payment, i.e. as a credit card makes monies available. I realize that the {$20000.00} remaining in the HELOC was, in effect, a credit card. However, since XXXX when I finally paid off the fixed rate loan, I have made monthly {$500.00} payments which equals $ XXXX/year.",Mortgage

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a purchase with my BARCLAYS credit card from a merchant, named XXXX XXXX  for an amount of {$1800.00}. The purchase was for international air travel, with a travel date of XX/XX/XXXX. I was unable to board my flight on XX/XX/XXXX, due to the negligence and/or breach of contract of XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX, but they were non-responsive to my requests for a refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sought reimbursement for my missed flight through travel insurance protection that I purchased in addition to the purchase of the airline tickets. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, the travel insurance company, XXXX, denied my claim and stated that the insurance policy I purchased did not cover negligence and/or breach of contract by the merchant XXXX XXXX. Some time in XX/XX/XXXX, I contact BARCLAYS via telephone I disputed the transaction with BARCLAYS, and a provisional credit was issued for the full amount of {$1800.00}. I was given a Case Number XXXX. I confirmed on that telephone call I had documentation to support my dispute, and the representative on the phone stated that if XXXX XXXX did not agree with my dispute BARCLAYS would contact me to provide documentation for review before the investigation by BARCLAYS was completed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received written confirmation from BARCLAYS that XXXX XXXX was notified of my dispute. On XX/XX/XXXX, I happened to log-in to my BARCLAYS online account and saw that the provisional credit for the disputed {$1800.00} charge was reversed. However, I never received any written notification of the reversal, or a request for additional documentation from BARCLAYS prior to that date. I immediately called BARCLAYS on XX/XX/XXXX, and was told by a representative named "" XXXX, '' that the investigation under Case Number XXXX was closed because XXXX XXXX provided fraudulent information that claimed I voluntarily missed my flight and provided a copy of its cancellation and refund terms for voluntary missed flights in response to the BARCLAYS investigation. I advised "" XXXX '' that BARCLAYS never contacted me during the investigation so I could provide documentation proving I did not voluntarily miss my flight, and I requested that BARCLAYS re-open the investigation immediately. "" XXXX '' explained that in order for BARCLAYS to re-open the investigation I must draft and send the request in writing. "" XXXX '' explained that in the meantime BARCLAYS could not re-issue the provisional credit, but that any interest on the charge would not accrue while it was still disputed after the investigation was re-opened. Finally, "" XXXX '' stated that if I pursued legal action against XXXX XXXX  and was successful, BARCLAYS would reverse the disputed charge at that time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I drafted a letter wherein I requested that BARCLAYS re-open the investigation for the disputed {$1800.00} charge, and outlined how I made multiple attempts to correct the charge with XXXX XXXX, but that XXXX XXXXXXXX was non-responsive. Additionally, I outlined that under my written credit card agreement with BARCLAYS, I was well within my rights to have the disputed charge removed as I fulfilled all three necessary criteria listed in the BARCLAYS agreement : ( 1 ) The purchase was made in my home state of California via an internet transaction ; ( 2 ) I used my BARCLAYS credit card for the purchase ; and ( 3 ) I have not yet fully paid for the purchase. Finally, I included with my letter several documents, which disputed XXXX XXXX ' claim that I voluntarily missed the international flight on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I filed a lawsuit against XXXX XXXX for the full amount of the disputed charge of {$1800.00}, plus additional damages. I waited to hear back from BARCLAYS, but I never did. On XX/XX/XXXX, a trial was held in XXXX XXXX County Superior Court, and the Court ruled in my favor for the full amount requested, including court costs, for a total judgment of {$2600.00} entered against XXXX XXXX, which included the disputed charge amount. On XX/XX/XXXX, I still had not heard back from BARCLAYS, but I noticed that the disputed charge was not reversed, and I was still being charged interest on the disputed charge on my billing statement, so I called BARCLAYS on the telephone. The representative stated there was nothing she could do over the phone regarding the interest still being charged, that the investigation was closed, and that I would need to draft a request in writing to have the investigation re-opened. I explained I already had done that, and was waiting to hear back from BARCLAYS regarding the status of the re-opening of the original investigation. The representative simply repeated that I must submit my request to re-open the investigation in writing. I advised the representative that I had successfully sued XXXX XXXX  for the disputed charge. The representative told me that so long as I could provide a copy of the Court 's judgment included with my written request to re-open the investigation, then BARCLAYS would finally reverse the disputed charge and credit my account for any previously paid interest associated with the disputed charge. The representative gave me a new Reference Number XXXX regarding my request. That same day on XX/XX/XXXX, I drafted a letter requesting that BARCLAYS re-open the investigation, reverse the disputed charge and any interest charges, and I included a Conformed ( "" Official '' ) copy of the Court 's Minute Order from the Trial, as well as additional supporting documentation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, BARCLAYS reported that they could not reverse the XXXX XXXX charge because they received terms and conditions of purchase from XXXX XXXX that stated "" Once purchased, tickets are completely nonrefundable & nontransferable. Any changes and amendments to the reservation are subjected to respective Airline rules and restrictions. '' What BARCLAYS failed to address is that term only applied to VOLUNTARY missed flights, not INVOLUNTARY missed flights. On two separate occasions I was told by BARCLAYS representatives that if I took legal action against XXXX XXXX and was successful BARCLAYS would then reverse the charge and/or issue me a credit to my BARCLAYS account. Again, any length of time that passed regarding reopening my dispute was due to BARCLAYS prematurely closing the dispute and/or not conducting a thorough investigation, and MR. XXXX has provided conflicting information regarding the Court 's findings in my favor against XXXX XXXX, now claiming this legal result has no bearing on BARCLAYS issuing a credit to my account. 

XXXX XXXX  is a company that committed fraud by providing false information to BARCLAYS during the initial investigation. I am a loyal customer of BARCLAYS and expected BARCLAYS to protect me against the fraudulent actions of a company like XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX lied to me personally, was negligent and broke the "" terms and conditions of purchase '' themselves, and then lost in court when I sued them. Because XXXX XXXX  is not a registered business in the two states it claims to operate ( TEXAS & NEW YORK ), I can not locate any of their company accounts to attach and/or garnish the judgment amount from my legal judgment. The only avenue I have to be reimbursed for the original purchase price of {$1800.00} is through disputing the illegal charge through BARCLAYS. This does not account for the additional damages I was awarded by the Court, I am only seeking to have BARCLAYS reverse and/or credit the illegal charge. BARCLAYS refusal to protect a loyal customer against a corrupt company like XXXX XXXX  is something I do not understand. Furthermore, in all its communications with me, BARCLAYS has never cited to any state or federal law to support its conclusions, nor to any term contained within the customer agreement I have with BARCLAYS. Given that BARCLAYS has not provided ANY legal support to the conclusions it has reached, I can not understand its response to my complaint. 

BARCLAYS representatives have told me on two separate occasions that if I took legal action against XXXX XXXX  and was successful, then BARCLAYS would reverse the charge and/or issue a credit to my account. Now, after filing a complaint with CFPB, BARCLAYS is claiming the Court judgment against XXXX XXXX has no bearing on whether BARCLAYS will reverse the illegal charge and/or issue a credit to my account. I suppose that now after successfully taking legal action against XXXX XXXX I will be forced to take legal action against BARCLAYS. This is unfortunate, as it is a waste of my time, and not the way to treat a customer.",Credit card or prepaid card
"regarding our XXXX XXXX card, they asked for reimbursement information to ensure that the purchases met the IRS guidelinses for purchases. First, we wouldn't have been able to use the card at those locations because the BIN is only able to be used for approved medical costs, "" Qualified Purchases ''. One of our Qualified Purchases is for an online medical visit, and the other is for a dental procedure. These should be obvious Qualified Purchases, without asking for receipts. Asking for receipts in these cases, where the spend and use should be brazenly obvious, is burdensome to the customer, and merely used as a method to withhold funds from being used by the customer. XXXX cards are funded by us, and ultimately we have the tax liability. So I'm really unsure why XXXX, UMB is giving us such a hard time. Perhaps they get some of the unused funds if they aren't used within the qualified timeframe? 
Notwithstanding the burdensome and deceptive practices, we provided the requested information to XXXX, which appears to have XXXX XXXX involved, and the XXXX card is issued by UMB Bank. 
After providing the information, we were met with a letter saying that our card has been suspended, and that we are no longer able to use it. Withholding funds means we can't pay our medical bills, and that subjects us to our credit being destroyed due to late and unpaid charges. We shouldn't have to chose between paying our medical bills and putting food on the table, when we have money in our XXXX, but it's being held captive unfairly by UMB and XXXX. 
Further, when we tried to call in to their customer service, there is no availability to access any customer service agent at all. We are only able to "" speak '' to an electronic service that will provide us claims dates and information. Completely unhelpful.

He wants to purchase a new car but wants his credit to be accurately reflected before it is pulled.     I have been trying to get  XXXX  to fix the inaccurate reporting for almost nine months. They have promised to call back and never do. They say they have to place the account in a dispute status which I do not understand when this information was already disputed, they sent me a letter stating it would be fixed, and they partially fixed it. I also do not understand how Equifax and  XXXX  can lower my credit score by  XXXX  basis points as soon as the account is put into a 'dispute ' status.  XXXX  lowers by  XXXX  basis points. If I am disputing inaccruate information on my credit report, why am I being penalized.

"I am submitting this claim because I had a Citibank AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard and on the anniversary of my credit card account, Citibank very unethically charged me the {$450.00} annual fee and then closed my account a few days later without notice and without an explanation. 

The Annual Fee includes a host of benefits, including a 1 year membership into the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Therefore, having been charged the fee, I expect to receive the benefit. 

Counter to any intuition, Citibank canceled my card, canceled the XXXX 's XXXX membership, and refuses to refund the {$450.00}. Therefore, Citibank has been unjustly enriched since I was forced to pay for a benefit I never received. 

I called Citibank Customer Service and they wouldn't help me. So I wrote a letter to the Citibank Executive Response team and they ignored my request to refund the {$450.00}.

"To Whom it May Concern : I am writing a complaint in regards to an outstanding balance I owe to BMO Harris Bank for a XXXX XXXX XXXX that is affecting my credit score. I am writing because I feel as if I was treated unfairly. I was going through a divorce at this time and I owned a XXXX XXXX XXXX, loan through a different bank, and my husband at the time owned ( loan was in my name ) a XXXX XXXX. When we separated I was left with the two cars and was not able to pay for both so I need to get rid of one. I went to XXXX XXXX, where I had bought my first car, to see if they would help. At this time, I had no idea what I was going to do with 2 car loans. When I arrive at XXXX they had told me I could trade in both my vehicles, both had depreciated value, and get a new car. Once this was in place I bought a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Going through the process of the loan, the car was worth around {$24000.00} but with both my bad equity from the two cars I already owned I ended up getting a loan for {$35000.00}. My car payments turned out to be around $ XXXXmonth for 7 years, which is very high. I said ok due to knowing I had to get rid of one car and being in a very emotional a distressed state of mind due to the divorce and worries of the payments I would have to make for 2 cars. I have made the payments for about 2 years and at that point was going through a transition with jobs due to the company going out of business so I returned the car back to BMO Harris. Once BMO Harris took the car they were to auction off the car, I received a letter stating the car was sold for around {$12000.00}. This still didnt cover what I owed to BMO. I still owe BMO Harris Bank {$17000.00}! I dont understand after making payments for so long that I would not even make a dent in my loan. I do not feel I should have received this loan in the first place knowing that it was too high of payments and income but that it was well over the value of the car its self. This is on my credit as a delinquent payment and is putting a hold on my future of buying a house. This has affected me with being able to be approved on even an apartment due to the bad credit. I dont feel I was treated fairly and was taken advantage of by being in a vulnerable state of mind, being very young and naive. I have requested from the bank to receive the loan agreement, payment history, and the auction amount but was denied this information. What I would like to see in the end if we could settle a balance on the car that is manageable to pay off that would make sense for all payments I have made or possibly forgiving the loan. I would like to buy a house in the near future but this has put a hold on things. Not only has this been a problem to get a house but this has been a problem everywhere. I would like to settle things to see my future in a better place. Sincerely,","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"During the period of XXXX our checking account was charged an excessive amount of overdraft fees : XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$25.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} XXXX : {$37.00} Things spiraled out of control and we are unable to catch up. Every deposit we made was eaten up by overdraft fees. I talked to a branch manager who credited our account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX overdraft fees, totaling {$70.00} but even then, things were so far out of control that we could not stop it. I have tried talking to customer service on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, but they said that there was nothing that they could do. I had previously called Huntington headquarters and spoke with someone in Customer Assistance and was told that there was nothing that could be done. I do n't mind paying for some of the charges since it was initially our fault that the account was overdrawn but to be charge over {$500.00} in overdraft fees is excessive. We were even charged twice in one instance with a {$25.00} sustained overdraft fee, so we actually got charged twice for an overdraft. 
And to make matters worse, Huntington claims to give account holders a 24 hour grace period if the account is overdrawn ; however, they do not notify you that the account is overdrawn until the day after it was overdrawn. Their notice states that a deposit must be made by midnight in order to avoid a fee, but again, this notice is given the next day and usually only 12 hours remains to bring the account current. With myself being sick with XXXX XXXX, and my father in law in the hospital, we could n't always run to the bank in time. I tried to speak to a branch manager about the notice actually only giving 12 hours notice but he stated that the 24 hour grace period starts when the account is overdrawn and it is policy to inform the account holder the following day. 
Here is a copy of a notice that I got recently regarding the 24 hour grace. Please read it carefully as the wording will show that the account holder is n't alerted until the following day XXXXXXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX ( 9 hours ago ) to me Your account ending in XXXX was overdrawn yesterday. We 're here to help. 

As a Huntington customer you have 24-Hour GracXXXX, which gives you time to make it right. Make a deposit today to fix the negative balance, and we 'll waive any fees from yesterday 's overdraft. Your deposit must be made before midnight CT and bring your account balance to at least - {$4.00}. The deposit must cover your current overdraft amount plus any transactions that may be processed today. 

To prevent future overdrafts and avoid fees, visit Manage Overdraft Options and tell us how to manage your transactions when you do n't have enough money in your account. You can pick the best options for you and find other valuable tools. 

If you have any questions, go to Huntington.com/grace, call XXXX ( XXXX ) or visit your local branch. 

With 24-Hour Grace we 're giving you more time, not more fees. 


It should n't be that they can punish an account holder for not having money by charging them so excessively. 15 overdrafts in a 2 week period of time, during the holidays is absolutely ridiculous!

"I work for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and my wife is a XXXX XXXX XXXX. We have XXXX daughters, ages XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. In early XXXX, with talks of possible layoffs of public workers due to the pandemic, first-responders and teachers included, we decided to enter the forbearance program for our XXXX XXXX mortgage. Prior to doing so, I emailed my XXXX XXXX loan officer, XXXX XXXX, and received assurances that our credit would not be damaged by entering the program and it would not create obstacles to refinancing our loan. Therefore, we did not make our scheduled mortgage payments for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020. When our XX/XX/2020 payment came due, we decided we felt secure in our jobs and finances to resume making normal payments as instructed by XXXX XXXX in order to exit the forbearance. On XX/XX/2020, we made our full mortgage payment of {$2300.00} for the month of XXXX, but the payment went "" unapplied '' to our loan balance. Subsequently, I contacted my XXXX XXXX loan officer about this issue and expressed our desire to officially exit forbearance. Mr. XXXX escalated the matter to the Executive Relations complaint team, and we were assigned Executive Relations Specialist, XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/2020, in order to take advantage of historically low interest rates and shed our monthly mortgage insurance payment, I initiated a mortgage refinance application with a new lender, Get A Rate, based in NJ. After our new loan officer made a hard inquiry to our credit reports on XX/XX/XXXX, I was advised that we could not proceed until the forbearance/deferred payment notes on our credit reports were removed, thereby showing we officially exited forbearance. On XX/XX/2020, I contacted Ms. XXXX from XXXX XXXX by phone who finally applied the funds for the XX/XX/XXXX payment and took our full payment of {$6900.00} for the months of XXXX, XXXX and XX/XX/2020 ( $ XXXX/month ), the forbearance period, in order for us to theoretically exit forbearance, as was my communicated intention. I advised her that we could not proceed with refinancing until we officially exited forbearance, meaning our credit reports had to be updated to no longer show the forbearance/deferred payments note and reflect a current balance, not a forbearance balance. MsXXXX XXXX advised me that she would work with the XXXX XXXX credit team to remove the note from our reports, show on-time full payments for XXXX, XXXX and XXXX, and update our loan balance to current. She said she had a calculated resolution date of XX/XX/XXXX, but she did not expect it to take that long. However, presently, this matter has not been resolved. Subsequently, we continued paying our mortgage as agreed under the terms of the loan and made our full, on-time {$2300.00} XXXX payment. Again, the payment went "" unapplied '' and I had to contact XXXX XXXX just for them to take our money and apply the payment to our loan balance. This indicates that somewhere in their system, they may still have our account in forbearance. Although our online XXXX XXXX account and current statement currently reflects the correct principal balance of {$210000.00}, our credit reports still, to this day, are showing "" deferred payments '' notes on the account and a balance of {$210000.00} which includes deferred interest from forbearance. Meanwhile, our new loan officer has made two more hard inquiries to our credit on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/2020, by trial and error, in order to see if our credit has been updated and we can continue with our refinancing. However, again, our credit reports are still showing as having deferred payments and in forbearance, with a loan balance that is not current and accurate. Also, as you may be  aware, excessive hard inquiries negatively impact credit. On XX/XX/2020, I received a phone call from Ms. XXXX at XXXX XXXX, who asked if there was anything else she could do to assist us. I advised her that the matter was still outstanding and has not yet been fixed despite her assurance of resolution and deadline of XX/XX/XXXX, which came and went without any communication, correspondence or resolution. On XX/XX/2020, we received a letter from Ms. XXXX at XXXX XXXX that basically says nothing is incorrect and they have not done anything wrong. I can not repeat this enough, while our XXXX XXXX online account and current statement shows a mortgage loan balance of {$210000.00} and reflects full, current payment through XX/XX/2020, our credit reports are still showing a note of "" deferred payments '' and a balance of {$210000.00} on the account which includes deferred interest from the forbearance period. This has prevented us from refinancing our mortgage with a new lender at historically low rates and from ridding us of our monthly PMI payment for more than a month, which would save us significant money. At this point, we are considering legal action, but after paying nearly {$12000.00} to XXXX XXXX in the span of approximately one month, we can not afford this option. We are completely current on our mortgage and have been since XXXX. We simply want the forbearance exit to be official as reported to the credit bureaus, our payments shown full and on-time, our balance correct, and move on with our refinancing outside of XXXX XXXX. We need our credit reports to accurately reflect that there are no deferred payments on the account, all full payments through XX/XX/2020 have been made on time, and the current post-forbearance loan balance of {$210000.00}. We have done everything we are required to do per the terms of our mortgage and it's way past time for XXXX XXXX to hold up their end of the agreement.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
"The process of applying for a mortgage began quite normally, I had individually received a pre-qualification letter in early XX/XX/2019 and went through the initial mortgage qualification process with a friendly and helpful mortgage specialist over the phone and via emal, upon which I began searching for a suitable property slightly below the pre-qualified dollar amount in order to get a preapproval I can use in the house purchasing process. I found a property and submitted a formal offer with a seller ( with a 45 day closing timeframe ending XX/XX/2019 ( originally ), a mortgage approval contingency and an earnest money deposit of {$10000.00} in the accepted purchase agreement sent to escrow ) on XX/XX/2019, upon which I began the mortgage commitment process with Citibank in order to be able to secure financing prior to the 45 day closing window. 

At this point, when the file was handed over to the loan processor and the underwriting team is when the process began to deteriorate. Our file, due to different requests for information as well as the addition of my wife as a co-borrower and her own, was sent back multiple times through Citibank 's underwriting and risk assessment teams, all the while that 45 day closing date was clearly communicated on multiple occasions to the mortgage specialist and loan processor respectively ( on the phone and via writing ). Initially I was assured that this date would be met, however it became clear about a week prior to the closing cut-off, and acknowledged by the loan processor in writing XX/XX/XXXX, that Citibank could not finish their process up and thus the loan processor requested an extension of the closing window in order to get a full approval ( which the seller also agreed to ), as Citibank were only able to supply a conditional approval as of that date. 

As I had business travel to XXXX already planned for XX/XX/XXXX and communicated this clearly to Citibank in writing as regards the logistic urgency of having a final approval issued prior to that, ultimately after some more underwriting review submissions and daily back-and-forth over the following 8 days I did receive a full approval Saturday XX/XX/XXXX ( I was advised by loan processor that it was issued Fri XX/XX/XXXX ... but computer system problems prevented its issuance until the next day ). 

My actual complaint revolves around the fact that, after Citibank issued me the approval and Closing Disclosure, and then notified me of a practical final closing date, and I in turn rightfully removed the financing contingency for the seller, that I assumed all was well UNTIL a senior mortgage sales agent from Citibank called me ON THE DAY OF CLOSING Thursday XX/XX/2019 and advised me the approval had been declined post-approval, prompting me to go in-branch, escalate and lastly work with Citibank 's Origination Advocacy team, who ultimately advised me that the approval was now declined ( even though I had already received it ). Obviously this caused no minor disruption in my personal life as now I was left in the lurch with the new home purchase falling through, existing residence already all packed up and ready to move out and a business trip overseas to go on that I would potentially come back from effectively homeless as a result of this extremely last-minute declination from Citibank under the most inconvenient of circumstances. The seller finally chose to cancel the purchase transaction that day and to keep my {$10000.00} USD earnest money deposit, and entirely due to what I feel is a major error here in Citibank 's handling of this matter.",Mortgage

"Our mortgage ( P & I, not including escrow ) is about {$6500.00} due to an initial bad mortgage in XXXX. We have tried to refinance it since then, but because of the drop in property value, the LTV ratio was not in a favorable range for refinancing and we have been rejected on multiple times. We submitted multiple applications for any form of assistance to our loan servicer ( OCWEN ), but we were rejected by the loan servicer every time stating that we were not eligible due to the investor guidelines. On three occasions we asked for information about who owns our loan and what are their guidelines, and every time they responded by providing a different entity 's name. In XX/XX/XXXX, according to publicly available land records we discovered that our loan was transferred in XXXX of XXXX, without any notification to us. After requesting for clarification, OCWEN responded by apologizing for their errors, and provided the correct investors name. Subsequently we requested for mortgage assistance and were told we won't qualify until we are at least late for one payment. We postponed making a payment in XXXX and our application was accepted. We provided all the necessary documentation and eventually received an offer for a three months trial period of {$5800.00} per month without any explanation regarding how the payment amount was selected and what it covered. We also were reminded that if we don't accept and sign their offer, we would lose our house. They assured us that we shouldn't be concerned about the trial payment because everything is subject to negotiation after the three months trial is successfully completed. Because we didn't want to be late on our payment, we made the first trial payment without signing any agreement and requested for an explanation of payment modification calculation in writing. According to the worksheet they provided, the majority of their calculations is based on incorrect assumptions resulting in a loan offer that is unfair and unaffordable. According to their worksheet, our income was inflated by {$7200.00} a year, and all other indicators such as income-debt ratio, total debt, ratio of mortgage to total gross income, etc were incorrect. When we challenged it, we were told that we had to submit our request in writing. After we submitted a request in XX/XX/XXXX, we received a response in XX/XX/XXXX, that they can not change the modification since we had already made a payment. According to their letter, for them to review our request ( their mistake ) we have to submit in writing declining the proposed modification, and resubmit a new application, however, there are no guarantees that they would entertain our new application. My wife and I are both government employees and our income is straight forward and publicly available. However, Ocwen insisted that they are correct in their assessment and our income is more than what we claim it to be. Ironically, we received a notice from our credit reporting agency last week, that OCWEN ( Maybe in retaliation ) has reported that we are late 90 days on our loan, which dropped our credit score by more than 200 points. We were not aware that while we make the trial payment, we are considered as being delinquent on our original payment. Furthermore, we were specifically advised that we should not pay our property tax or home insurance since the trial payment is collecting for an escrow account. On XX/XX/XXXX we were notified by our insurance company that they are going to cancel our home insurance and Ocwen has refused to pay. We were also notified by the County that our taxes are not paid as was due by the end of XX/XX/XXXX and we were assessed a penalty. It seems the focus of OCWEN is not on helping their customers but showing the regulators how many applications, they have processed. It is always challenging just to reach out to them and when we do, often they either provide you with an incorrect answer ( seems deliberate ), or delay answering by asking to submit our concerns in writing. Based on a simple web search, it is evident that their track records are not favorable toward their customers. Thanks for your consideration of this complaint.",Mortgage

Also, the appraisal was flawed and contained incorrect or incomplete information which had an effect on the interest that they were quoting me. I requested a full refund and was led to believe that I was at fault because I did n't want to come to the table with a deposit and the appraisal ( incorrect appraisal ) could still be used at a different lender. I do n't believe it fair to not return any portion of my expense when I was led to believe one thing and they changed at the last minute to requirements that they knew I would not be able to meet.

"A dispute was created on XX/XX/XXXX regarding an existing issue. The issue is that a negative pay status was reported on my account on XX/XX/XXXX which caused credit score to decline. Since XX/XX/XXXX my credit has been increasing due to timely payment, loan pay-off, etc. Credit score has increased by at least 30 points. Recently, an inquiry/dispute was opened with Experian due to new evidence which I believed would have been helpful for Experian to over-turn the neagtive pay status. On XX/XX/XXXX, 10-days after the dispute was opened, Experian reached out with the dispute result. 

The result stated that the negative report can not be over-turned. The issue is that Experian removed the negative pay status that was created on XX/XX/XXXX and re-inserted the negative pay status once again on XX/XX/XXXX which caused credit score to decline sharply. Not only there was no gain from the dispute/inquiry created with Experian, but somehow the dispute adversely affected my credit score. I was not warned that creating a dispute will cause credit score to decline. I have been paying all my bills on time which was causing credit score to increase. It is extremely unethical for a credit reporting agency to adversely affect a credit score for a simple inquiry. This adverse activity was not caused by new untimely payment or any new issue. The negative pay status had already existed and nothing was gained. 

I am asking that Experian would re-adjust the negative reporting status as well as the credit score. A  simple dispute should not decrease a credit score by any margin. I have been paying all bills in a timely manner. If I had know this would happen, I would have never created an account or created any inquiry/dispute.

"I am complaining for the second time about the same issue : the Chase XXXX XXXX ( being marketing as a premier travel card ). Again, I discovered no auto payment was taken out.

Again, looking online at my account, it is impossible to ascertain exactly the timing of credits and purchases to see if my credits are over my purchases for a particular time period.

Given that the purpose of utilizing AutoPay is to cover all payments due - Chase is putting consumers in an untenable position. It's not possible to tell exactly what is due because of the way they provide information online and their Customer Service people are responding with 'nothing is due. '' Secondly, again, as the card is being marketing as a premier travel card - sending notification via paper of card in errors - is disingenuous. They can do this of course, but if the consumer has elected email notifications - precisely because they travel - then the company is best advised to provide notifications in duplicate or triplicate or however they wish but certainly in the manner the frequent traveler has requested. Bottomline - Chase appears to be "" tricking '' the customer into non-payment.",Credit card or prepaid card

"The following explains an issue that I have, which has yet to be corrected as of this date XX/XX/XXXX. <P/><P/>TransUnion File # : XXXX, Tax Lien Release Re-dispute Dear Transunion LLC, I would like to put into dispute an item TransUnion placed on my Credit Report ( a copy of TransUnion Credit Report is attached with the yellow highlighted items ). <P/><P/>The attached TransUnion Credit Report, dated XX/XX/XXXX, on Page One, lists the following under Public Records, with the Registry of Deeds for XXXX XXXX County, in XXXX, Massachusetts : Two tax liens had been placed on my property by the State of Massachusetts Department of Revenue ( Docket item # XXXX ), and the Internal Revenue Service ( Docket item # XXXX ) for outstanding taxes owed for the tax year XXXX, prior to my filing of Tax Returns for the tax year XXXX. <P/><P/>Upon filing my personal income returns for tax year XXXX, formsXXXX with all Schedules, it was concluded by both the State of Massachusetts Department of Revenue and the Internal Revenue Service that there was no tax due, nor tax liability. Consequently, the State of Massachusetts released the Lien and it is noted as Released in the Public Records. The Release of Federal Tax Lien by the Internal Revenue Service was also filed, as Released, with the Registry of Deeds on XX/XX/XXXX. <P/><P/>However, both items are noted on my TransUnion Credit Report, dated XX/XX/XXXX, as being an Individual Debt Responsibility, and marked as Paid, rather than saying simply no taxes were due and consequently nothing was needed to be paid, and as a result, the Liens are released. <P/><P/>To reiterate : the conclusion upon filing my XXXX Personal Income Tax Return Form XXXX complete with Schedules, was that no taxes were ever owed to either the State of Massachusetts or the Internal Revenue Service for that year. The TransUnion Credit report for me shows the Liens as Paid, reflecting a debt owed, rather than simply Released. Since no taxes were owed after satisfying the filing of XXXX tax returns, there never was a debt. <P/><P/>In speaking with the Registry of Deeds for XXXX XXXX County, in XXXX, Massachusetts, as the TransUnion Credit Report states as being the source of the data used on my TransUnion Credit Report, the Registry only posts the information which is sent to them, without changes. The Federal Lien on the TransUnion Credit Report clearly shows the word Paid, whereas that wording is not used on the official document Release of Federal Tax Lien, as is clear when you read the Release document attached. Enclosed is a copy of Federal Form XXXX ( XXXX ), Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien supporting my position. Also enclosed is the Release of Massachusetts Tax Lien. <P/><P/>I am requesting that TransUnion correct and or remove the item ( s ) reported as such by TransUnion. There was no tax due to either the State of Massachusetts nor the Internal Revenue Service for the tax year XXXX, and reflect instead there were no payments needed to be made. <P/><P/><P/>Considering that the overall scoring of XXXX and XXXX exceeds my Credit Score from TransUnion by approximately 10 %, the difference seems to lie in the description of the Released Tax Liens. The nuance between Paid and Released, implying the existance of debt, versus Released easily accounts for this. XXXX  actually removed both Liens altogether from my Credit Report as they were not  owed as debts and did not belong on their report as an example of debt record. The description changes my score category from Excellent with XXXX  and XXXX to Good with TransUnion, which is significant. <P/><P/>In closing, if you would be so kind as to make the corrections as requested above, and issue to me a new TranUnion credit report which hopefully reflects those changes. <P/><P/>Thank you for your attention to this matter,","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"Id called Capital One on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX to set up a 3-installment payment plan for my over-limit balance. Dates which my bank account was to be debited were meticulously picked out and thoroughly discussed during that recorded phone call on XX/XX/XXXX. The first of which was to be Friday that same week, XX/XX/XXXX. When the payment wasnt withdrawn on the XXXX I figured okay, maybe itll take the weekend since its the first payment. Maybe theres some sort of timing issue with it being a Friday. But when the payment still wasnt withdrawn from my account on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Capital One to inquire as to why. They told me the payment plan was not properly processed on XX/XX/XXXX. They then told me the payment of {$330.00} was now ~ {$410.00}. This upset me because Id already budgeted and prepared for the agreed-upon amount of {$330.00}. So my account was sent for review. Then I get an email from my credit bureau stating theres been a change to my score. Come to find out Capital One reported a missed payment ( the payment they hadnt properly processed ) to my credit bureau on XX/XX/XXXX. When theyd done it a second time the following month I again became upset and discovered its illegal for a credit card company to report anything to any bureau for an account that has a dispute. Which mine does. Furthermore, the missed payment was the inaccurate {$410.00} amount. Many phone calls later Capital One tells me theyre adjusting the credit reporting and credited my account {$50.00} which allegedly got applied a month ago. Yet I hadnt heard until a month had passed? Weird. {$50.00} in no way helps anything. And today I receive an email stating that my credit card will be charged off if I dont make a payment.

Second, my friends who applied this card earlier or in the same time with me with the help of other staffs in XXXX XXXX Bank of America have all got the cash rewards, they can be proofs to me.

But until today they told me I can not get the cash rewards because of a ridiculous reason.

( a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting The Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system is dependent upon fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine the public confidence which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system. ( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers. ( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers. ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and a respect for the consumers right to privacy. ( b ) Reasonable procedures It is the purpose of this subchapter to require that consumer reporting agencies adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer credit, personnel, insurance, and other information in a manner which is fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and proper utilization of such information in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter. YOU ARE NOT REPORTING ACCURATE INFORMATION, AND YOUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ACCURATE CREDIT REPOTING IS UNFAIR.

"On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, two certified mail return receipt requested letters were sent out to Experian indicating that I wanted to have an alleged bankruptcy filing be looked into that dated back to the year XX/XX/XXXX. This alleged bankruptcy filing is out of the US Bankruptcy court in XXXX XXXX, California. I asked Experian to validate and verify this alleged court filing. On both occasions they have failed to provide me with any VIABLE EVIDENCE. I requested to see documentation bearing my signature, or a physically signed court order by a judge, or even a physically signed bankruptcy petition bearing my signature. I received nothing to physically have this debt verified by the source, which in this case would be the US Bankruptcy Court in XXXX XXXX, California. Instead I receive generic letters from Experian telling me on the first time that they will not investigate something that was already investigated by them a while back, and on the second letter, I received a response stating that they have VERIFIED this debt with the source of the information, and if I didn't agree with their findings, then I can contact the source of this information. Mind you, neither time did I receive what I had asked them for, which was viable evidence that connects me to this court filing. I did not feel that they conducted a REASONABLE INVESTIGATION as outlined in the FCRA, nor was I supplied any hard, physical documentation that would prove that this did, or did not, belong to me ; also another violation of the FCRA sections 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ).

Per Experian 's suggestion, I contacted the Bankruptcy court by mail and by telephone to inquire about their procedures in verifying anything with the credit bureaus, etc ... The court told me that they do NOT verify anything with the credit bureaus and that they are NOT responsible for their actions. This is their policy so that they can be in compliance with Federal Privacy Laws that are currently in place. With that being said, I find Experian to be in yet another FCRA violation, the law clearly states that verification needs to come from the source in order for it to be valid, but in this case, or any case pertaining to a court house, Experian did not verify, or validate this court filing with the court house ( source ), and yet they are still sending me letters to my disputes which state that they have verified my request for the validity of this court filing. Furthermore, I hardly would consider XXXX XXXX, or any other third party reporting agency, a viable means to verify my dispute and my request for physical verification of this court filing. IT IS NOT. Either way, I have opted out of XXXX XXXX XXXX  information sharing, or suppression, as I believe they call it in light of Equifax 's data breach, which I was a victim of. So, how is it that Experian is receiving ANY information from lexis nexis regarding anything that has to do with me in the first place? I have opted out. And I have proof of that. I was approved for the suppression of my file with them. This would go for ANYBODY, asides from law enforcement, to be able to receive my information from them.

So, if the court isn't verifying, or validating anything with the credit bureaus, and XXXX XXXX, Clarity, Pacer, and a bunch of other third party reporting agencies have been opted out from their information sharing/suppression, then how have you reasonably, and legally verified this alleged court filing? With whom? As of right now, I have you on several violations of the FCRA, and I also have you on yet another violation too. This other violation is that you have failed on every written response to have you investigate, dispute, and validate this court filing, you have blatantly failed to indicate on my credit file with you that this item is currently under dispute. In fact, as of today, it's still not their. I have enclosed evidence of such. I have also enclosed evidence of everything else that I am claiming here. This other FCRA violation would be out of section FCRA 605 ( f ).

As it stands right now, you are in violation of the following FCRA sections : 605 ( f ) ; 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) ; and 611 ( a ) ( 5 ) ( A ). Also, I have you for Defamation, willingness to enable identity fraud, and Negligent reporting. You have willingly refused to do anything that I have requested of you to seek proper verification of this court filing, and I will file a lawsuit if this item is not rectified, and immediately deleted from my credit file with you. You have had almost 60 days to verify with hard, viable, physical evidence that this is indeed my court item, and you have not been able to successfully do so. I want this item removed from my credit report with you immediately. You've had more than enough time, and you are well past your 30 days as required by federal law. Thank you.

My statement balance autopay was triggered to pull exactly {$920.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. However, the autopay pulled my payment twice, XXXX on the XXXX and one on the XXXX in the amount of {$920.00}. Because of the two payment my next statement balance cut at {$820.00} which was due by XX/XX/XXXX I have noticed this system error on XX/XX/XXXX and requested to refund back one of two statement balance payment. Instead of refunding the agent performed a payment reversal. At this point I do understand that my statement balance is no longer {$820.00} and should be {$820.00} + the reversed amount of {$920.00} ( the system error double payment reversal ) Because of my statement balance autopay setup I did not worry about checking if the autopay will pull both the reversed amount and previous statement balance amount. In the end the auto only pulled {$820.00} instead of $ XXXX {$920.00} and considered me delinquent and charged {$11.00} of interest. This is obvious system error that I was initially put into this in the first place because Goldman pulled more the required amount to pay. This seems illegal use of autopay where banks are pulling more than authorized and also more than required to pay.

I did complain about this and explained very clearing what caused this interest and the agent kindly waived the {$11.00} of interest. At this point I expected Goldman to take the initiative to watch out for any trailing interest that this will cause. As planned my autopay for statement balance was made and unsurprisingly I saw trailing interest of {$9.00}. I requested again to waive but the agent was not able to waive because of previous cycle {$11.00} interest waiver.

In their response, they said that THEY WERE ALWAYS LICENSED AND BONDED IN THE STATE OF TEXAS and they were so kind ( and deceptive ) to give me 'proof ' of a BOND NUMBER XXXX to search within the Texas Secretary of States site for third party debt collector searches. I did do that search and XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, WAS and IS bonded in Texas. SO ... I called the SOS and asked for their assistance to search the database for any traces of XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX. What I was told and you can confirm with the SOS is this ... XXXX XXXX XXXX IS NOT BONDED IN TEXAS ... FURTHER THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN. Within the search pattern, it will say if they had and/or if it had lapse. IN XXXX case, they are nowhere to be found so are in fact with the State of Texas, a NON-Bonded company. I was told by the Secretary of State representative that XXXX MUST HAVE A SURETY BOND IN PLACE IN ORDER TO ACT AS A THIRD-PARTY DEBT COLLECTOR IN TEXAS. According to Texas law, because XXXX is reporting into my ( and other Texas Consumer ) credit files, ALL WITHOUT BOND, this is considered INDIRECT COLLECTIONS, and is a total violation of my rights under both Texas and Federal Laws. 

Today, I updated my complaint with the Texas Attorney General 's office. I am attaching the XXXX INITIAL RESPONSE THAT YOU HAVE from my first complaint ... The one you closed without checking the validity of XXXX ' response. Today, I am here filing another complaint with the CFPB, with the sincere belief that if you take the time to read this lengthy complaint you will see DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES in full view. In the response that you receive on XX/XX/XXXX from an XXXX official, they told CFPB and myself, that they WERE Bonded. My complaint was against, XXXX. This other ye-hoo company they brought out of the closet was not then on my nor my attorney 's radar screen, well until then. So my complaint was in total directed at XXXX. Their CFPB response was deceptively crafted to create the illusion with the CFPB and myself, that they WERE ... mean XXXX as they were the target of my complaint ... That THEY, XXXX was bonded. They cleverly gave you a bond number. Did you not check that bond to see that it was NOT XXXX bond. I can tell you definitively that XXXX has never been bonded here. YET ... they still being allowed to post derogatory remarks into my credit file ... Well, mine and every other Texas consumer that is dealing their deceptive practices. AGAIN FOR THE RECORD ... FROM THE TEXAS SECRETARY OF STATE,  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX IS NOT BONDED IN TEXAS. PERIOD! YET, Texas has a MANDATORY SURETY BOND REQUIREMENT. Are they not REQUIRED to abide by Texas Laws? What about federal laws regarding DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES? Are blatantly constructed false statements into a FEDERAL site, that has oversight over that industry NOT important to the CFPB? I surely hope they are. I can tell you that while my complaint may fall here, they assuredly will not with the Texas Attorney Generals office nor with forthcoming civil actions. What about my rights as a senior citizen under the Consumer Protection Act, or Fair Credit Practice Act, or the Fair Credit Collection Reporting Act, or the Texas Finance Code, Section 392. Do any of these matter? I wonder. XXXX  XXXX XXXX is a non-bonded company ... I have had now four communications with the Texas Secretary of State. Two I initiated, two they called me on to discuss my situation with XXXX. My understanding is that the SOS is in contact the Attorney General 's Office and good news for me, I have two complaints now in his office and a third coming tomorrow. All breaches of the above acts. I have notified all three credit bureaus of they non-compliance in that they are allowing a NON-BONDED company to access to my credit files. We will see if they want to formally meet XXXX in court I guess. All my credit files now show XXXX with a CLOSED STATUS YET ... this week, XXXX had access to my credit file enough to FLAG It as Collections. A NON-BONDED company, practicing deceptive trade with false statement into a federal site in order to squelch my consumer rights of complaint ... Still with complacent accessing to my credit bureau files at XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

What I hope for is that you will realize that were blatant deceptive trade practices is exhibited that CFPB has a responsibility to me as a senior citizen to protect my consumer and FEDERAL rights. They are each being trampled on in this case. I am demanding that XXXX and all traces of them and ANY affiliated companies be removed from my credit files. I also trust that when you get another very craftily written deceptive response from them, that you will investigate and read their carefully crafted and obviously deceptive XX/XX/18 response. It clearly shows their obvious intent to squelch a legitimate complaint with a response that was INTENTIONALLY CONSTRUCTED TO DECEIVE THE CFPB AND ME AS A CONSUMER.",Debt collection

The unpaid principal balance for the FHA PHH Mortgage Loan Account Number unpaid principal balance was over billed an additional {$21000.00} and PHH Mortgage received another {$21000.00} from HUD!

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX XXXX that states theunpaid principal balance for Account Number XXXX is now {$170000.00}.

Payment was sent late and the Insurance company cancelled my policy retrospectively and sent me the payment.

Guaranteed rate had then placed a Lender placed insurance at an high price on my behalf and sent me the bill. I had refuted this and they said they will review it and fix it. 

In the mean time they had transferred my loan to Chase and Chase asked me for the amount for the Lender Placed Insurance ( LPI ) When I conferenced with them with Chase they had mentioned they will cover it ( See secure message from chase as a result of the conference attached ). 

Guaranteed rate said that it was paid for by Guaranteed rate but Chase has to straighten its record. 

Chase dispute resolution had reached out to them and are notifying me that I owe the amount as they are unable to resolve this with Guaranteed rate.

We finally made contact with XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, ( and XXXX XXXX XXXX, who never got back to me as promised ), and made an offer based on what we had heard for XXXX about the amount of the balance owed.

In this process we discovered that after we notified XXXX that we wanted to pay off the First Loan on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, they quickly sold the note to XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Why the rush to sell this note when we were trying to pay it off. Then we discovered that XXXX had sold the same note to MTGLQ Investors, L.P. on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, over a month before they actually owned it.

"XX/XX/XXXX To Whom It May Concern : I would like to share my experience on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX in XXXX, Georgia. I purchased a new XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX. I was assured that the price that I was paying was actually a good price for what the car was worth. I requested a drive out  price of {$43000.00}. I let the dealership know that my credit bureaus were locked due to previous identity theft. Unfortunately, I was not able to complete the transaction that day due to a power outage. I spoke to XXXX XXXX and instructed him not to shop my credit until the bureaus were unlocked then he could proceed. I returned to the dealership on XX/XX/XXXX, to complete the paperwork and take delivery of the car. I was surprised that the finance department added several warranties that I never asked for. I had previously purchased a warranty through another company so therefore, I knew that these charges were not previously authorized. I expressed my concerns and was assured that these fees could be removed within 30 days if I choose not to keep them. It was with this assurance that I closed the deal. I also asked who was the bank that they financed my loan through because I was not aware of the lender. I was again reassured that it was just one of their other lenders because XXXX XXXX  denied my credit due to the locked credit. I took delivery of the car. Over the next few weeks, I received several letters from banks that denied my credit due to the credit bureaus being locked. This annoyed me since I asked them to wait for my permission, but at this point there was nothing that could be done. About a week and a half later, I received a letter from a lender that stated my loan could not be approved due to negative equity in the car. I called the dealership and spoke to Mr. XXXX who listened to my concerns. I stated that I was told I couldnt refinance my car for four months by XXXX in the finance department. This was odd because I have never been told this before. XXXX stated that the dealership would not get paid for the car and I would lose my rebates. The irony is in spite of these rebates, I was informed by several banks that the car was overpriced. Mr. XXXX stated that he would investigate my concerns and return my call. Rather than Mr. XXXX returning my call, a man named XXXX called. I explained my concerns about my credit, and the questions regarding the value of the car. I was assured that the car was valued at the price that I paid. I was offered a free car wash for the credit issue, I told XXXX that this gesture would not suffice if this car was overpriced. Additionally, I told him I would be able to verify his claim of value once I refinanced the car. It was a couple of days later once I tried to refinance the car that my worst fears were realized. My credit union stated the car was priced {$10000.00} over book value. I was mortified. I again reached out to the dealership and actually spoke with the owner Mr. XXXX, who stated that I got a beautiful car and a fair price. He offered to speak to my credit union representative to assist in refinancing my car. However, this never happened. Their finance department spoke to their representative from my credit union who refused to discuss my loan as they didnt have my permission. I asked XXXX XXXX to call my loan officer and he refused. He only provided the sales paperwork. Needless to say, that deal never came to fruition. I sought out the assistance of a local bank and I gave them Mr. XXXX information and the bank stated he never returned their call. I'm very disappointed in the treatment that I have received. I'm a single mother that is possibly responsible for {$10000.00} that should have never been charged to me. The finance department knew this fact because they chose a lender unbeknownst to me that I recently discovered financed my loan without verifying the value of the car. This car is below XXXX XXXX value and this value was verified with an appraisal with an independent company. I have excellent credit and I didnt have to have a questionable lender to finance my car. This dealership did this in order to defraud me. This practice is totally unethical. It is my hope that someone can provide any assistance to resolve this matter.Thanking you in advance for your consideration in this matter.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"Nature of Complaint : Freedom Mortgage Senior Loan Officer offered me a refinance rate of 2.75 % and promised to lock it in on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, just before scheduled closing week, I learned that he never locked the rate in. Current rates increased and our cost to refinance also increased significantly. Freedom Mortgage promised to honor the original offered made and then 12 hours later decided that they were not going to honor their offer / commitment. 

Specific Details of entire experience : On XX/XX/2021 I contacted XXXX XXXX, senior loan officer from Freedom Mortgage. I indicated that our family was interested in refinancing our current home mortgage. XXXX communicated an offer interest rate of 2.75 % and indicated that he would lock the rate in for us. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX mentioned that, as a result of our credit scores, he would need to charge us a XXXX pt. fee in order to offer the 2.75 % interest rate. We decided and communicated with XXXX that we would still like to move forward with the loan. On XX/XX/XXXX, we exchanged some information pertaining to the loan and learned that we would close on the loan mid to end of XX/XX/2021. Two weeks past and I did not hear anything from XXXX or Freedom Mortgage. I sent a text message on XX/XX/XXXX checking in to see if our refinance is still going according to schedule. XXXX replied saying yes, everything is on track and our projected close date is the week of XX/XX/XXXX. Two more weeks pass and I do not hear anything. I follow up again on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure that we are still on track for closing the week of XX/XX/XXXX. That week goes by and never hear confirmation from XXXX. I contact his Supervisor XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to try and find out why XXXX will not respond to me. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX over the phone XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ) and explained my circumstance with him. I indicated that I was concerned the XXXX was not getting back to me regarding the status of our refinance. XXXX mentioned that my entire loan experience working with XXXX does not seem normal and he would look into it. I asked if he could give me an update by the end of the business day ; he said he "" definitely '' would. The entire day passed and I followed up with XXXX at XXXX. He said that I would hear from XXXX that evening. No call came, so at XXXXXXXX  I followed up with XXXX via text message and I asked him when he would be calling. He replied back "" tomorrow morning after I submit your rate lock .... ''. I immediately called XXXX XXXX to find out what in the world was going on. 

XXXX XXXX told me XXXX on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX that XXXX never locked my interest rate in as promised on XX/XX/XXXX. He said the rates have since gone up but he will honor the rate that XXXX and I agreed to. I asked him if he could waive the points and he said "" no, because the loan will now cost more and Freedom Mortgage can't cover the entire cost ''. Since my back was against the wall and I did not have any other options, I reluctantly agreed although felt that Freedom Mortgage should pay whatever additional fees there are ; I should not have to pay any penalties. XXXX promised that he would keep a close eye on my loan moving forward and I would not be disappointed.

"I had initially gotten a loan through through a company by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX of 2016. The payments that i had agreed to was around 380 a month, and i would usually pay early payments, or sometime even divide my payments up into 4 payments a month, and pay every week, as well as paid extra to pay down the balance. 8 payments later i receive a phone call from a company by the name of Innovate Auto Financing telling me they purchased my loan, and gave me the website where to set up an account to make payments to going forward. At first i did not think anything of it until i had asked if i had any paperwork to confirm, sign, or agree to and they told me that it had already been taken care of. I expressed how i didn't agree with this, however they informed me that I really did not have a choice that it was between my previous loan company and themselves. I then googled this companies name and saw nothing but negative remarks on XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, their own company website, etc. on how they always buy existing loans from other companies, they have rude customer service, incorrectly distribute your payments with no explanation, they do late and incorrect credit reporting etc. I did not want this company to assume my loan due to this.I called XXXX and they told me that they had none of my information including contracts, proof of previous payments, or anything that to do with my account because it had already been sent to them. They did not report my payments or account balances regularly, and only to one of the three bureaus. I immediately began to receive calls soon after stating that i had an overdue balance of XXXX dollars that never was received from the previous company. I called Innovate auto and explained to them that i did in fact make the payment, and also provided bank statements and proof of the payment i made. They would place me on hold and transfer me to a supervisor where id leave a voicemail and wait for a callback, I never would get one.They told me that they could not verify the payment unless XXXX sent it to them and continued to attempt to collect payment, call me continuously, charge interest and late fees to my account for months until they located the payment i assume. Numerous times i would have to call my banking service and have customer service on the line in a three way call in order for them to confirm a payment that had been made months and months in advance and that they could not locate, only to still be charged interest on the payments that they could not locate. Every month after i made a payment, i would receive a statement in the mail letting me know of the payment i had due, as well as the distribution of my last months payments towards interest/principle that would fluctuate. Some months it would say that XXXX of the XXXX dollar payment i made went towards interest, while a negative amount was applied to my balance. Sometimes it would show that only a couple tens of dollars went toward it. There was never an average or simple interest distribution towards my accounts principle that can be calculated to see where the money i was paying would go. Every time i called Customer service was in fact rude. They would hang up on me at times, as well as tell me things like "" they're not mathematicians '' when i would ask questions as to why i was being charged so much. At times i would pay extra, they would take the extra that i payed and apply it to the next months balance, and continuously keep doing that instead of applying the full payment to my account. I asked them why and they said if i wanted it to go towards my account i would have to call them, and let them know how i wanted it applied every payment. I grew tired of the inconsistencies, so i finally called and asked the company to send me a breakdown of my payment history. After many months of steadily asking weather they were going to send me anything, what they sent me was to printed sheets of paper that showed three or four payments a month, when i only made one payment a month with this company. It didn't show a starting balances, ending balances, my rates, none of my information, etc at all, just the multiple payments with different distributions in each one. This paperwork too was unofficial, and inaccurate so i began to question the morality of it all and asked for them to send me a copy of the contract they received from the previous Company. They then told me that they are not going to send me one because i should have had all of that information when i left the car dealership. I told them i knew what i signed for from the dealership but i was curious as to see what they had and were showing to see why i had been charged so inconsistently. They then told me that i had an interest rate that is above the legal limit in the state of Texas. When i informed them about this they'd either hang up on me, transfer me to a voicemail which id never receive a callback, or they'd just simply be smart and argue with me. They belittle you and tell me things like your just trying to get a free car because you cant afford one and numerous other demeaning things that frustrate you to the point that you just don't want to deal with them anymore. Instead they should be informative, fix your account and adjust your payment distribution to where your account shows a correct balance.since they have not provided me me with any paperwork i have stopped paying them and stored the car. They continue to report late payments, despite attempting to correct my accounts balances, or even provide me with any type of paperwork.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

Please see the attached agreement which again states that "" Maturity Date The Shared Appreciation amount, if any, at the Maturity Date shall be 25 % of the difference between the Valuation of the Property as of such date and {$110000.00} ( the Interest Bearing Principal Balance '' as of the Modification Effective Date ( emphasis added ) less any credit determined by Servicer for Subsequent Capital Improvements and any amount of appreciation in excess of Deferred Principal Balance. '' When we pulled these documents up on their website today, they had the wrong Modification Agreement attached with Notary Signatures also. 
Questions : Was {$170000.00} really forgiven? It does n't sound like it to me. 
Why would we be told this reverts back to the original loan of {$390000.00}? This is absolutely no where on the Agreement.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent a written request to remove PMI from mortgage XXXX. This conventional loan is serviced by Dovenmuehle Mortgage , INC . In our letter, we specifically requested that the seasoning period be waived due to the extensive and substantial improvements we have made to the property in accordance with the written policy provided by their company for this procedure. The improvements were listed in the letter requesting removal of PMI and were verified during the property inspection by the Inspector who conducted the appraisal. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the appraiser, paid for by us and selected by the mortgage holder, went through our home for hours, taking pictures of all rooms and all angles of the inside and the outside of the house. The new appraised valued our home at {$530000.00}. Dovenmuehle Mortgage has a copy of this document as they forwarded it to us. The appraised value at the time of purchase in XX/XX/XXXX was {$400000.00} and the original purchase price was {$380000.00}. The payoff balance is about {$360000.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the mortgage holder declined the removal of the PMI based on LTV ratio using the original appraised value of the home ( {$380000.00} ), not the most recent appraised value ( {$530000.00} ). We feel that this was an error on their part. Current LTV ratio of our home using the new appraised value is under 70 %. According to their own policy, they should have dropped the PMI at that time. 

We spoke by telephone with a representative of their company on three separate occasion on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX about this matter, and each time we were assured that they were aware of the new, assessed value of the home and that there was a clerical error on their part that prevented the correct decision from being made. We were also told that a representative of their company would file an appeal on our behalf, since the error was admittedly theirs. They also told me on each occasion that we would receive a written response from them in 10 days. The last deadline was XX/XX/XXXX. That date has long passed with no information, no contact and no response from the mortgage holder. 

We sent a written request to appeal their decision via certified mail 10 days ago but have not had any response to that request either. We also requested reimbursement for all PMI money we have paid to you since XX/XX/XXXX. We are unable to contact this company by email and they do not have a direct dial phone number that we can find.

"Hello. I had a change in homeowners insurance back in XXXX of XXXX. This has caused a 2 day lapse. My bank contacted me to let me know that I owe {$12.00} for this 2 day lapse. No problem, I simply added this amount to my normal payment. I didnt straight up say, this is the {$12.00} for escrow, no now they claim I didnt pay it. Due to this error, the bank has placed forced-insurance on my home which is doubling my payment. I cant afford this. I have gone around and around with my bank and they claim that I am past my timeframe and they refuse to release the forced insurance. Remind you I have had adequate homeowners insurance this entire time. My lapse was from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX, they started the forced placed insurance XX/XX/XXXX. Ive been trying to work with them but they refuse. Now they are sending my foreclosure letters. I have been paying my mortgage minus the insurance.

"I send follow letter to Westlake Financial Dear Sirs ; Last XXXX / XXXX2020, I spoke with 2 customer service agents, and nobody supported me in my request, the first person hung up on me, Agent XXXX XXXX, and the second character, I don't even remember the name, by the way he does not speak Spanish very well, he was a man who informed me emphatically that they CAN NOT HELP ME. 

This day ( XX/XX/26-2020 ) I spoke again, to request help, in the sense of the EXTENSION OF 2 MONTHS of payment of my credit, I have been without a job since last XX/XX/2020, to date ( COVID-19 ) I have been punctual with my payments, but I am like a good percentage of the world population, with financial problems due to lack of income. 

So in the most attentive way, I ask you to approve the extension request, so that the lack of payment does not affect my credit record. otherwise I will find myself in the painful situation of stopping paying the credit and going to whoever is competent to denounce the lack of support from Westlake Financial.

"I got the personal loan from Stilt because I needed help last year around this time taking care of a few bills. What I didn't know is that my dad would end up passing in late XX/XX/XXXX  ; so, I ended up using much of the funds for those expenses. I am still dealing with expenses from that time, which is why you will see that most of the payments, although still ahead of the 30-day mark ( that affects credit reports ), have been late. I mentioned all of this to the Stilt rep at least a month ago when I first started having greater difficulty making my installment payment before the 30-day mark. I called then trying to make payment arrangements so that payment wouldn't result in a negative mark on my credit reports. I was coldly told on the phone that nothing could be done. I hung up with no resolve. I got a follow-up from someone via text chat saying that although a payment arrangement COULD be made, that they still couldn't do anything about the 30-day due date and that I would still be risking a negative reporting. Thanks to their lack of leeway, I indeed ended up with a negative late payment mark on last month 's credit reports. I had difficulty again in this latest 30-day cycle ( 30 days as of the XXXX or XXXX of XXXX ), making it two 30-day late payment marks on my credit reports. In addition to difficulty paying, it is also how my employment checks come. My checks come thru a couple days early on Wednesdays every two weeks, so this week, my check fell on the 30-day mark. There's nothing I can do about this. So, if I'm strapped for cash, I can forget being able to pay until the check finally comes thru. Sometimes it arrives in perfect time and sometimes it doesn't. Because of the brick wall I got the first time from Stilt reps, I didn't even bother to call this second time to make any payment arrangement, and had to "" simply '' wait until my check came thru despite whether it came before, on, or after the 30-day mark. I have never in my life dealt with a creditor who refused to allow any understanding or grace in special circumstances such as mine. I don't even know what to do or if Stilt will even care, but I am submitting this complaint anyway. It is a shame that I have gotten all this way with "" on-time '' payments -- no negative credit reporting -- and now, as I'm halfway thru paying the loan off, I have two late payment marks thanks to their lack of care for customers. I also do not like that it's such an incredible feat to get ahold of someone. Their phone most of the time goes to voicemail, and when I've finally gotten someone, they're impersonal, cold, and do not work with customers. I believe this is a tech company under the guise of financial services, as many tech companies are impersonal, lacking customer service, and have a 'take it or leave it "" business model and not 'customer first '. You all need to understand that you will not have any business without customers -- and that I am not just a number in your system. I tried to work with you all to get a human answer to a human situation to get my bill paid on time, not have a normal situation be made into an inconvenience for your ready-made system, and not cause negative marks on my credit reports.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"
"I am an essential worker in XXXX during this current XXXX virus pandemic.

This drop was due only to the first credit check that was due to the COVID virus requirements to have a credit check before being able to simply see any property. This is totally unfair and does not provide a true reflection of credit worthiness.

Step 2 : What type of problem are you having? 

American Express is refusing to honor the terms of the offer I signed up for. Multiple representatives have claimed the offer must have included "" once in a lifetime '' language and so I would not received the bonus since I had previously held the Platinum card some years back. 

However the offer I signed up with did not contain such language, and I have the entire offer terms printed out as evidence. 

I require that American Express award the promised XXXX Membership Rewards point. I also require that American Express stop ignoring the documentation provided. I finally require that American Express stop attempting to change the agreed to terms after the fact. 

Step 3 : What happened? 

I first contacted American Express about this issue on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative stated that I would not received the bonus offer since I had previously help the Platinum card. I communicated that the offer I accepted did not include those terms and I had documentation of those terms. The representative opened an investigation and requested that I scan and upload the printed out offer terms document I had. I followed those instructions, and the representative informed me the process would take 6-8 weeks. 

I next contacted American Express on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the status of the investigation and the representative informed me that it had not yet been completed but would take a maximum of 6-8 weeks so I should check back again. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted American Express again. The agent and the agent 's supervisor stated that the investigation was still not completed despite the timeframe having passed 8 weeks. They also informed me that American Express would not notify me when the investigation was concluded, and that I would have to continue to check back regularly. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I again contacted American Express. The representative again claimed I was not eligible because I had previously held the card. I noted the open investigation, and the representative 's supervisor finally looked into the investigation history and stated it had not been concluded yet despite more almost two times as long a time had passed as the 6-8 weeks maximum. 

Finally on XX/XX/XXXX, I called American Express and talked to three different representatives. The final representative stated that corporate headquarters had concluded their investigation and declined to issue the bonus with no explanation.

"NOT A DUPLICATE Amerisave incorrectly established the opening mortgage balance on my loan and, in addition, has not accurately posted a payment to my mortgage balance. 

On XX/XX/2020, my wife and I settled a mortgage with Amerisave. The settlement included a payoff to the outstanding mortgage of {$330000.00} and other charges/impounds/fees of {$18000.00} for a total amount borrowed of {$350000.00}. ( See Settlement Statement.pdf ).

Amerisave established the mortgage on their online serving website with an opening balance of {$350000.00} and a opening interest payment of {$260.00} for a total opening amount of {$350000.00}. ( see Loan History.pdf ) The online amount includes an additional {$31.00} ( {>= $1,000,000} - {$350000.00} = {$31.00} ) that was not included in the Settlement Statement. ( See Mortgage Reconcilliation.xls - Part 1 ).

In addition, Amerisave did not correctly apply my payment of {$3000.00} ( Check # XXXX ) in relation to my XX/XX/2020 mortgage payment. 

Amerisave claims that this payment was included prior to the establishment of the balances on their mortgage servicing website ( see Draft DMI.doc ). The reconciliation detailed above shows that the loan amount from the Settlement Statement equals the opening balance on their mortgage servicing website ( except for an unreconciled {$31.00} ). Therefore, Amerisave did not correctly apply the amounts from my Check # XXXX - or the opening balance would reflect this reduction in principal. Since the opening balance does not reflect this payment but rather the opening balance ties back to the original Settlement Statement, the Amerisave records demonstrate the payment was not applied.",Mortgage
"In XXXX, we filed a chapter XXXX bankruptcy in XXXX. In the bankruptcy we listed a house which had an FHA loan on it. The loan was serviced by Countrywide, who was purchased by Bank of America. We did not want to keep the property. The bankruptcy was approved, and our debts were discharged on XXXX. 

Since that time, the lender has refused to take the title to the house. We have made many attempts to sign over the deed. I have many notes of telephone calls, etc. They were not returned. This past year we even hired an attorney to contact BOA to facilitate signing over the deed. Her calls were not returned either. 

We have been told by several banks that we are unable to refinance our current mortgage or obtain a new one until this house is out of our name. Worse, we have been told that if the bank takes it by foreclosure, it will appear on our credit report as a new foreclosure, just as if a new financial crisis occurred instead of dating it back to XXXX. 

We believe that this situation is fundamentally unjust. We had to file for a bankruptcy due to a total XXXX. We are trying to get the fresh start which the bankruptcy laws are designed to provide. We have been managing our financial affairs quite well in the over six years that have past. How is it that Bank of America can be allowed to crush our future? 

We suspect that the whole problem is the FHA mortgage. As we understand it, when a borrower defaults, the US government steps in to make the mortgage payments. This continues as long as the house remains titled to the borrower. If the bank takes it back and sells it, the bank only receives a portion of any loss from the government. We understand that banks might or might not be the ultimate bondholders of the GNMA pool containing the mortgage. However a servicing fee is paid to the the bank. What inventive does Bank of America have to take back the title? From where we stand, they have no incentive. 

An interesting contrast is found with the other property we listed. That was not insured by the government. The lender with that mortgage took the title immediately, and sold it. The entire matter was complete within six months of discharge. 

We are asking the CFPB to investigate why this is taken so long, especially given the heavy documentation of our willingness to sign the deed over. Further we want the CFPB to insist that our credit not be harmed any further",Mortgage

"I have been unemployed since XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been trying to make a deal with Wells Fargo, XXXX loans The School XXXX XXXX, they were going to put the payments that I was behind on at the back of the loan and start me off fresh. I was told ( multiple times ) that everything was all set, only to have the "" deal '' fall through because of one stipulation or another. First being that it was my parents that were paying it ( they are not on the loan ), the second was ( at the time ) I owed over {$60000.00}, and third : I had not made 2 or 3 consecutive monthly payments. The last guy I spoke to ( I think his name was XXXX or something of the like ) actually got down on me for questioning the process and after that "" confrontation '' I noticed on my credit report next to Wells Fargo was the note "" dispute of debt, dispute resolved ; costumer disagrees '' which I was very confused with. I never disputed the debt I disputed the fact that they said they would help me and they did n't, every time I would call or contact someone they were like ok we can do this then the end result was nothing can be done, just pay it. 
Essentially, I have been jerked around by them, when all I have been looking for is help, I want to pay it, and I would pay it if I had the means to do so. I have been trying to get a job, any job, for about XXXX years, I have applied to over XXXX jobs, all over the country, I have all of the rejection letters ( when they think to send them ), the e-mails I have sent to them, and all of the cover letter I have written, I have been trying SO hard to get a job. I have no vehicle, and because of where I live, ( with my parents ), there are no close places of employment to even get a minimum wage job ; providing they would even hire me because I am "" over qualified. '' Of the jobs I have applied for I have had XXXX phone interviews, XXXX in person interviews, and XXXX informal, in person conversation. I have been trying to sell my personal things, so I may be able to pay my loans, but I have not been unable to sell a thing. Im quite honestly doing everything I can to obtain money, legally, to pay them. Up until now my parents have been paying my bills but they can no longer afford to help me. I literally have {$7.00} to my name. 
I called Wells Fargo today, to see if there was anything that can be done because I am in such dire circumstances, they didnt even want to talk to me ...

I just do n't understand how they are expecting me to pay when I have no means to, and I dont understand how they refused to help me, I 'm sure they see it differentially but facts are facts. I would be homeless if not for my parents. The only way one can get blood from a stone is to beat a person with it and I sincerely feel that way. I have my government student loans set up so I dont have to pay anything based on my income, they based it on the fact that I have not filed taxes in 5 years.

"I closed on my house on XX/XX/XXXX with PrimeLending A PlainsCapital Company. The closing documents stated that my monthly payment ( principal, interest, escrow ) would be {$1400.00}. I've made every payment on time if not earlier than the due date. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a notice from my lender stating that due to my annual escrow account disclosure statement, my escrow had a shortage of {$1100.00}. The statement that was sent said that because originally the {$480.00} I was paying to my escrow would not be enough to cover my taxes in XX/XX/XXXX they have to raise my monthly escrow charge to {$550.00}. All together the shortage fee and the new escrow charge is raising my monthly payment to {$1600.00}. 
This was shocking because according to my county tax office in XXXX Texas from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX my taxes went down from {$4600.00} to {$4500.00}. I filed for my homestead exemption in XX/XX/XXXX and it now shows on the XX/XX/XXXXtax office documents. 

I called PrimeLending that evening and tried to get an answer as to why there was a shortage and what would have caused this but the only answer they would give me is that "" my taxes went up and there isn't enough money in my escrow to cover it. I now owe them {$1100.00} and they are raising my monthly escrow deposit to {$550.00} to cover next years disbursements. '' I then asked again where they are getting these numbers from and the representative repeated herself but then also read the Annual escrow account disclosure statement to me line for line. I said thank you for that but that doesn't explain where you're getting these numbers. 
I proceeded to say that the information they have cant be correct because the XXXX XXXX shows its lower by {$100.00}. The representative stated that "" if I have documentation of this discrepancy that I could fax it to their office and they would research it and adjust it back if needed. '' The fax number they gave me was XXXX. She told me to send the documents with a cover letter attention Research department along with my loan number. She said it can take up to 20 days for them to process the new information and for my account to be updated. I took screen shots from the XXXX County Appraisal Districts website of my XX/XX/XXXXtax information and I sent these documents on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I emailed my loan processor who processed my loan asking for her to call me because I had a few questions. She never called or returned my email. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called PrimeLending again at XXXX XXXX and asked if they received my documents and if there is any update in the situation. Their representative XXXX, said they never received my paper work and that I should try sending it again. This time XXXX told me that in addition to sending the screen shots, I should also send copies of my home stead application and the XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX notice of appraised value I got in the mail ( which matches the screen shots I took off their web page ). 
I then again asked, where are you getting this information and can you send me a copy of your documents showing why I have shortage and what proof they had to back up this increase. She then told me to "" look at the annual escrow account disclosure statement they had mailed me and that it explains everything there. That is how they base any shortage or overage on account escrows. '' After this call I pulled out my closing documents and started going through them. When looking at page 2 of the Closing Disclosure I discovered that under Other Costs - section G there is a line for Property taxes and it says {$320.00} per month for 12 months which totals to {$3800.00}. That raised a flag because that didn't match anything I had from XX/XX/XXXXwhen I purchased the house or from the current tax year XX/XX/XXXX. I went back to the XXXX XXXX site and started looking at previous years. I started at XX/XX/XXXX where I found that the taxes almost matched the closing documents, they were only {$.00} apart. It appeared PrimeLending had used the wrong tax year on my closing documents. The current years tax information is available to view online in XX/XX/XXXX and our tax office mails out a hard copy of this information the first week of XX/XX/XXXX. There is no reason why the XX/XX/XXXX numbers which were a year and a half old at that time should have been used on my closing documents. 

I then called PrimeLending back once again on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and spoke with their representative XX/XX/XXXX. I asked where the property tax number came from on my closing documents, She couldn't tell me. knowing the information I had just discovered, I then asked do you use old taxing jurisdiction numbers to get people a lower payment up front on their loans and she said, yes. I said, you don't use current numbers for closing, then expect people to pay for it later? she said, sometimes. I said, now I have to pay a fee because someone either didn't do their job right by using up to date numbers or purposefully used old numbers to trick me into using their lending company? she said, that's just how it is sometimes.",Mortgage

In retrospect, the transfer occurred at XXXX PST and I reported it no later than XXXX PST ; 5 hours later. Within the initial call, I was informed that I would not be liable for the fraudulent activity and that American Express would be liable for the losses and appreciates that I reported it as soon as I had. As well as the investigation conducted by the back-office team, would take 7-10 days. I let the Customer Service Rep know, that I would be filing a police report and would call back with the Case number, as advised. 

After the police report was filed, I immediately called in with the case number and officer on the case. [ Exhibit B ] I was informed that it would be forwarded to the back-office team for review. The following day, I called for an update and was told there is no update at this time. Of my knowledge, my card and account were still up and running. In that case, due to every dollar being stolen from my account, I had no money to get by for the week. My Sister, who has a serve account as well, attempted to send me {$200.00} and was unsuccessful.

In a complete frantic state, I call back in hopes of speaking to a Manager of which I was unable to speak with anyone except a supervisor. As a card holder, I have the right to know what is going on with my financial information, personal information and the status of my dispute.

Moreover, given that Ms. XXXX is named as every officer and sole director, she would be the only individual capable of authorizing any endorsement of the cashiers check.

"I submitted a complaint a couple of months ago and got a response that was not satisfactory since the mortgage company still has not accounted for all of the money in question. I reached out to the individual who replied to my complaint like she told me to do with further questions, but its been a month and still has n't returned my call. 

Here is the original complaint : Since Seterus started servicing my loan ( XXXX ) I have always been on time with my payments. I recently refinanced my loan with another bank in XXXX and during that process I called Seterus to ask about my payment history/payoff letter and we uncovered that I was showing late each month since XX/XX/XXXX. 
Looking into it further, my loan is a modification which started in XXXX and for 5 years the interest rate stayed the same. In XX/XX/XXXX, that interest rate changed causing my payment to increase by a little bit. I was unaware ( being 5 years later ) that the change was happening because I was never notified by Seterus. They told me because of my bankruptcy ( XXXX ) they could not send letters asking for money, but when it impacts an account to this magnitude I 'm not sure why. If my payment changed because of escrow they sent me a letter so not sure why they did n't do it for this change in payment. I paid my regular payment like I always do on XX/XX/XXXX for XXXX 's payment in the amount of {$1700.00} and since it was short by about {$80.00}, I was told the payment went into a suspense account thus not paying XXXX payment. A simple phone call or some sort of correspondence would have corrected this problem as I have always been on time with my payments, but I received nothing so I thought everything was okay. I should have at least been giving the opportunity to correct this in XXXX and not find out I 've been delinquent 8 months later. Since that time, my account has shown late every month and late fees were being pulled from this suspense account ( again no notification ). In XX/XX/XXXX a fee of XXXX was pulled from the suspense account for some sort of corporate advance fee?? With all of the late fees and the XXXX fee for who knows what, it still does n't come close to adding up to my original payment and they told me the suspense account had a {$0.00} balance. This simple lack of communication had put my account delinquent and I have always made my payments on time. ( Please check history ). 
I am no longer with Seterus, but I am asking if you can review my account and their deceptive practices. This lack of communication on their part has cost me hundreds and hundreds of dollars in fees and if I would have been notified about the gap in payment, I would have paid the extra XXXX that was needed to pay XXXX 's payment and I would n't have been in that situation. 

Since this communication they have admitted fault and credited me {$440.00} in late fees ( Attached ). They also show a credit on the payoff letter of {$800.00} which brings the total credit to me of {$1200.00}. Since my original payment that went into the suspense account was {$1700.00} that leaves {$500.00} still unaccounted for. I would like to see all transactions that came out of the suspense account that will account for every penny of my payment because as it stands now I am still owed XXXX. 
I have attached all of the paperwork that Seterus sent to me, but it does not provide an accounting of transactions from the suspense account.",Mortgage
"The specific problem here is Citibank 's failure to take XXXX "" declined '' transactions out of its "" pending transaction '' queue for my credit card. The more general problem is the absurd administration of the queue for various transactions. The attachment shows that queue for my Citibank AA Platinum credit card. 
The specific problem arose because on XXXX XXXX, 2015 my daughter ( a cardholder on the account ) went to purchase XXXX season ski pass for the ski slopes near hear college for {$500.00}. The transaction did not go through. She kept trying to submit it and ultimately a {$500.00} charge went into Citi 's system 4 or 5 times ( I 've been told different things by Citi during calls with Citi ; they should have call logs ). According to Citi, all such transactions were declined. However, 6 days later, there are still XXXX "" pending '' transactions for {$500.00}. Those all use up my credit limit. Ultimately, on XX/XX/XXXX, my daughter tried the transaction again and I am told by her that it went through. 
I 've called and emailed Citi asking them to get rid of the already "" declined '' transactions. In response, I receive emails that tell me the transactions can remain in the queue for up to 30 days ( see the attached emails in the image file ). You need to issue a regulation that stops such stupidity and unfairness. 
More generally, this little mess caused me to look at how long some things sit in the queue. You can see for yourself when you look at the list. It 's absurd. There are XXXX day old gas station charges. There is a XXXX XXXX charge for {$100.00} that no doubt is a placeholder charge from my stay at a XXXX LAST WEEK. I checked out XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Obviously it 's easiest for merchants and Citi if they act slowly, if at all. XXXX, for example, should close out the placeholder. And, Citi should void out the XXXX declined ski pass transactions for {$2000.00}. But instead, they do not and I end up wasting my time on this nonsense. Moreover, it may be that these long delays help the bank to rack up "" over limit '' fees from many of its customers. As we all know, today 's banks are all about hitting consumers with fees. This may be the same scam as stacking checks ahead of deposits in order to create overdraft fees in checking accounts. 
In sum, since Citi and others fail to act in a timely or responsible manner to clear out old transaction, you need to issue regulations that force timely and responsible action. Yes, it will cost Citi money to do things in a timely manner, but that 's what should be done and having more employed people would be a good thing.",Credit card or prepaid card

"On XX/XX/2019, I filed a complaint against PayPal, XXXX, incredibly I received a response from Synchrony bank, which did not address the issue at all. The response from Synchrony simply gave me a history lesson, thank you for telling me what I already knew. 
SO LET 'S DO THIS AGAIN and I will word my complaint differently so there is NO confusion. 
PayPal ( not Synchrony Bank ) targeted and solicited me to open a PayPal line of credit. Promising zero interest and 6 months or more to pay for items over {$99.00}. 
I APPLIED ; and was approved my credit score was XXXX. 
The line of credit is now attached to my PayPal account. However PAYPAL, not Synchrony Bank, does not allow me to use the line of credit as an OPTION for any purchases at all. I have made a dozen attempts over the last 2 weeks, from {$40.00} to {$700.00} each and every time with a merchant that accepts PayPal Line of Credit. BUT, PayPal does not give me an OPTION to use the line of credit I was approved for by Synchrony Bank. I will provide screenshots of my attempts and you will see the OPTION to use the PayPal line of credit is NOT available for me. I have made at least 9 inquiries and every time get the identical standard auto response. I have done nothing to break any agreement because I have not had a chance to use the line of Credit. PayPal has not asked for an additional information of provided a valid reason why I can not use my line of credit, This is FRAUD by PayPal and I have been harmed. 
In Summary again to make sure whoever reads this understands. 
1. PayPal solicited me to apply for a line of credit 2. I applied and was approved through Synchrony Bank 3. My line of credit was attached to my PayPal account 4. I get solicitation every day from PayPal to use my line of credit 5. I have made over 9 attempts to use my line of credit with merchants who accept PayPal but PAYPAL refuses to allow me to use the Line of credit for anything. Paypal simply has blocked my account for access to my PayPal line of credit. 
THIS IS A EASY CLASS ACTION as PayPal misleads every single consumer. What PayPal really does is make a credit decision against each consumer for each purchase attempt using the Paypal line of credit. If I knew this is why PayPal really did I never would have applied and gone through this XXXX. 
Any XXXX search will reveal the thousands of identical complaints. 
****Lastly, I do NOT want and do not authorize and phone calls from PayPal in their response. I want all communication in writing to make sure both sides have an accurate record.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"
"NorthEast Recovery Solutions LLC XXXX north XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, ny XXXX XXXX contacted me regarding a debt I owe. The message they left on a business phone contained most of my personal information. It also contained language about a pending complaint filed against me in my county. I called them back at the number they provided- they gave me more data, but would n't let me talk in any way. Then my husband called them back, she did n't verify any data, just proceeded to give him all of the information and then proceeded to insult my character on the line. She would not provide any data as to who her company was or their contact information. I called them again and asked for her supervisor, her supervisor said that she sits right next to this person and that she did everything right. That she would not review her call and that she, the supervisor, had no superior to speak to. 
They proceeded to dial over and over again to all of our numbers, from phone numbers that varied. When I called back to discuss the reference number they left me and to ask them for their company name and contact information - i was disconnected. 
I called back and was told that I need not call them again as they would file harassment charges against me for merely asking them to identify themselves. 
The woman proceeded to contact my husband, to tell him that I was threatening them and using foul language with them. Complete and total lie. 
I filed a complaint with my Attorney General who confirmed they are n't even licensed to collect in the state of Colorado. 
Not only would they not identify themselves, they gave away personal information without verification, they defamed my character, and then would n't deal with me on my own debt and threatened to file legal action against me for wanting to know who I was dealing with.

Then on the day I was originally suppose to close, USAA calls me back to tell me they have fixed everything ( I was on my way to another borrower ). So during the XXXX stint, we had to provide things that we had already provided ( twice ). Horrible.We kept calling because they were running against the clock to provide the documentation to the closing attorney 's office. Finally, we close.

This company has ruined my credit score so  bad I got denied a loan for my house!! Now I can not provide for my family because of these derogatory marks. These medical bills and other derogatory collection accounts listed on my credit report, are incorrect and NOT mine. Simply verifying that someone used my name, social security number and/or address is insufficient to confirm that I am the person in question and owe this debt. 
The court has ruled that in Hinkle v. Midland Credit Management , Inc., that during a dispute and subsequent investigation with the original creditor, collector or a credit bureau, that the original creditor or collector, must provide account-level documentation that would hold up when presented to a jury. That means an original contract or similar proof. To this end, I am demanding an itemized bill to be sent to me! 

The account information that this company is providing can not be proven because they do not have the original signed document saying that I owe them a debt which is A direct violation of my CIVIL RIGHTS according to the FCRA section 609. This company must remove their account from my credit reports immediately and permanently. A DELETION OF THIS ACCOUNT FROM MY CREDIT REPORT IS A FAIR RESOLUTION.

I have received a response that does not indicate or prove : 1. I had this service.

2. What services I am being charged for.

3. What the cost of each service I am being charged for.

A response with a bill is NOT evidence of proof that the debt is mine. Anyone can open an account under my name for which a bill is produced, but that doesn't mean it was actually me or that the debt is actually mine. I need real evidence. This evidence consists of a contract from the original creditor or some agreement bearing MY written signature agreeing to pay the debt. In the absence of this evidence I ask you to please remove this account from my credit report.

I will proceed with legal action as prescribed by law against the above-named original creditor/collection agency. Should this item not be deleted within the required time allowed by law I will seek every legal remedy available to me and file suit against the credit bureau responsible for reporting this violation.

I urge you to take this extremely seriously as I have documented my case without error. I encourage a response from you expeditiously.

XX/XX/2021 at XXXX PM, I contacted Capital One again and was told by the representative the card was not connected to the account I use for debit card purchases.

"I sent a dispute letter into Equifax advising them there were alleged accounts that were showing on my credit report showing false and misleading information. All the banking institutions showing on the report are FDIC insured banks. Federal Reserve Policies and Procedures and the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) requirements imposed upon all federally-insured ( FDIC ) banks in Title 12 of the United States Code, section 1831n ( a ), prohibit them from lending their own money from their own assets, or from other depositors. So when they are claiming there is a debt that is owed to them, this is false and misleading. Equifax supposedly did a verification, but has not been able to prove the actual alleged accounts. I believe the information above proves there is no way that any of these alleged banks lent anything of value that they would 1. Have a claim too and 2. Be the creditor, because they legally can not lend their own assets or other depositors money. There are also court cases as such : The United States Supreme Court and the lower courts have long recognized that the banks can not loan credit.In the federal courts, it is well established that a national bank has no power to lend its credit to another by becoming surety, endorser, or guarantor for him.

This all happened from the past 4 weeks and is still going on. I am having a major problem with my Citi simplicity credit card and I have been through absolute XXXX with their customer service for hours and hours and days and days and I just can't take this anymore. I have made a lot of payments on my card to get rid of the cash advance fees but I have now had my card blocked because they said I have 2 returned check fees and a failed debit payment. When I looked on the statement I saw that they indeed received those payments from me with a confirmation number on the exact same days that they gave me those fees. The money has been taken from my bank account and they have put a hold on XXXX XXXX $ payments all while giving me those return check fees. After fighting with them for so long I finally started to make progress as they were going to remove those fees and put my money back on the card as well as I was promised by multiple people that since I went through all of this for no reason that they were going to give me XXXX dollars worth of credits because of how badly I was treated. This was all promised to me from managers. It has now been a week and they put XXXX on my card which I went to go use and they declined it and took it right back. I was so upset that I was promised all of this for everything they put me through and received nothing.

I spoke to someone in client services at CPA and was told they would call XXXX XXXX right now to confirm the payment and would call me back, neither of those things happened.

Flagstar also did not properly update this information. I was NEVER informed of this transfer and Flagstar can see I have never been late on this account until they wrongfully forgot to update my address.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
"Transunion, XXXX and XXXX are all reporting incorrect items on my credit reportand to date have ignored our attempts at getting these items removed, corrected and changed?! We certainly know our valid correct legal names, where we have ever lived in XXXX years of marriage and where we have never lived or had a postal box?! Alsopublic records is reporting incorrect information on a supposed judgment by XXXXfiled in XX/XX/XXXX and no later where we have a letter from XXXX and the FDICstating very clearly that NO SUITS were ever filed. The XXXX accounts in question were charged off in XX/XX/XXXX. We think these judgments should be dropping off as we are in the XXXX year time frame now and that legally they should never have been filed if in fact they were as we were in a debt settlement program with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, AZ from XXXX and the XXXX accounts were in the program which XXXX agreed to?!","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
Items were not investigated. Contacted court house stated they do not report information to credit bureaus. Transunion stated they verified the information and it is not factual and is inaccurate.,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

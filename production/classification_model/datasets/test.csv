"XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX / XXXX XXXX : Loan # XXXX Property address same as above To Whom It May Concern : This is regarding a bank load ( mortgage ) that when into foreclosure on our residence listed above. We were offered verbally ( and also by letter ) a chance to modify this loan under an agreement of a trial period of three months. I, XXXX, verbally accepted this program immediately ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ). The three month trial period consisted of paying the amount requested by Capital Bank on time or before the XXXX of the month beginning XX/XX/XXXX through XXXX XXXX, XXXX in the amount of {$730.00}. My husband and I agreed to this and complied with their request. Thus far, we have wired 2 payments on time with the third being due XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

The XXXX lien being in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$50.00} and the XXXX lien being in XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$2900.00} again from The XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
First of all my husband and I were not born as of XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX we were XXXX year old. 
Capital Bank refers to our residence which did n't exist back in the above dates rather was built in XX/XX/XXXX. 
The property ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, New Jersey XXXX ) was left to us via inheritence in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time there were no liens on this property. Furthermore, in XX/XX/XXXX we borrowed {$200000.00} from ING Bank and the liens did not appear at that time either. 
We have been informed that ING Bank was bought by Capital One Bank. 
Capital One has put my husband and I back into foreclosure and is preparing to take our residence away due to these liens. It was not the mortgage we were behind on rather the property tax. The taxes were to be included with our mortgage modification and that is what we are now paying on the mortgage including taxes.

"On Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to a bank to open a new account. I was told that I needed to lift a security freeze on my credit reports to open this account. I asked what credit reporting agency they used, and they told me Equifax. 
So I went home to look up the PIN I was sent when I created the freeze on the Equifax account and tried to lift the freeze. Their website indicates that one has to make a myEquifax account to lift and place security freezes. Their privacy disclosure stated that there was a phone number I could call if I didn't want to create a myEquifax account. I tried calling that number, but it did not have any options about lifting/placing security freezes. So I decided that I had to create the myEquifax account to temporarily lift the freeze so I could open my bank account. 
I made the account and logged in, but the website told me that I could not log in and to call customer service at XXXX. I called and was able to have the freeze lifted so that I could open my bank account. When I asked about the website, he told me that it was down and to try again in 24 hours. 
I called again on Sunday, XXXX XXXX, 1926 hours later, and I still experienced issues with not being able to access my account. The representative assured me that it would work in "" one hour 's time. '' I waited 90 minutes and tried again to access my account on myEquifax.com. It still did not work. I called customer service again and asked them to look into the problem as I wanted to know the status of the security freeze ( whether it had been reinstated after the temporary lifting ) and see for myself that it was done. The first agent I spoke with on Sunday expressed amazement that anyone had told me it would take only 24 hours or 1 hour to fix the issue. He transferred me to his supervisor, who then transferred me to "" myEquifax technical support '' for more help with the issue. 
I was told by the myEquifax technical support person that the website had been down for days, that they were "" adding features to the website, '' and that the website was down while they were "" updating the website. '' I asked why they didn't do upgrades on a non-live website so that they didn't mess up access for people, and she couldn't explain. She told me to write a letter and send it to the credit dispute department ( even though this has nothing to do with a dispute about anything on my credit report ). 
I called again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, after I decided that I didn't want Equifax to have access to my email address as well as wanting to recuse myself from the terms of their privacy policy, specifically the term that allows them to place robocalls to me. I talked to a succession of representatives who were unhelpful, telling me that they had no access to delete my information or telling me that I should just "" call back in 48 hours '' or "" call back in 7-10 days '' to see if the issue was resolved. Finally, I got to talk to a manager who seemed to be competent. He changed the email associated with my account to a fake email ( something that I would not be able to receive ). I got a notice of the email change to my email account. I told him that that was not acceptable as Equifax would then send information to the fake email address and I would be bound to the terms of that email without knowing about it ( as I could not access it ). I told him that he needed to delete the entire account to ensure that I would not be bound by terms and conditions that I had no way of receiving. He said that he could not do that and hung up on me (! ). 
I called back and again talked to a succession of customer service representatives, the last of which told me that I no longer had a myEquifax account associated with my name. However, I can not get any verification of this except by trusting the agent on the other side of the phone line. 
I was told that they are unable to send confirmation of changes via the U.S.  Postal Service and that they could not show me the information that they have on me in my account.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"Background : In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) held both the Promissory Note and the servicing of the mortgage on my home. During the process of renegotiating the loan, the authenticity of the signature on the note came into question. Within three months of the signatures doubtful authenticity becoming apparent, XXXX sold the note to PNC NA ( PNC ).,  but retained the servicing. 

In XX/XX/XXXX XXXX started foreclosure action against me, using this spurious note. At the time, as per the Revised Code of Washington ( RCW ) 61.24 et seq., it was required the Beneficiary offer to mediate prior to foreclosure. I was not offered this option prior to commencement of foreclosure. I was informed, AFTER commencement of foreclosure, that I had chosen not to mediate. However, the date when I supposedly selected not to mediate, I was in a training class sponsored by the US Department of Commerce ( document I ). This falsified XXXX  document was included in the Notice of Default in XX/XX/XXXX. 

One of the requirements of the mandatory Washington State foreclosure mediation process is for the Borrower to produce a government issued identification with a signature and address to certify that they are the owner and that they occupy the property. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX documented that the signature on my government issued ID did not match the signature on file i.e. the Promissory Note. At this time, XXXX XXXX, an organization contracted by the State of Washington to facilitate the mediation process, suggested that I contact an attorney as this problem was out of their charter. 

Mediation plans were agreed upon and proceeded, however, the Beneficiary failed to comply with the dates proposed and it had to be rescheduled several times. The mediation was held on XX/XX/XXXX. It was attended by me, XXXX XXXX, the alleged note signer ; my attorney, XXXX XXXX ; the mediator, XXXX XXXX ; attorney XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) the Trustee ; and a representative from PNC, XXXX XXXX. The PNC representative attended via telephone. PNCs representative put a proposal on the table verbally. It was agreed to by the parties. The Mediator agreed to continue the mediation to XX/XX/XXXX, after requested financial documents were produced. My documents were delivered to the Beneficiary in a timely manner ( XX/XX/XXXX ) showing the ability to meet revised loan requirements. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, the Trustee complained to the Mediator that documents had not been delivered, claiming that additional documents were necessary. These additional documents were in fact documents that were not articulated nor agreed upon during the first mediation session. The Mediator did not follow up on this claim made by Mr. XXXX with me as per Department of Commerce mediation guidelines. This specious claim by the Trustee ( XXXX ) effectively torpedoed the mediation process. On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX announced it would cease operations on XX/XX/XXXX and all accounts would be transferred to other firms. In addition, on or about XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX employment was terminated at PNC. I filed a complaint on this matter with the Washington State Attorney General concerning the issues of misconduct and malpractice on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Sometime either before or after this XX/XX/XXXX date, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ), initiated an investigation into the Beneficiary according to documents obtained in discovery ( document II ). This electronic communication gives a date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
On or about XX/XX/XXXX a new Successor Trustee was appointed by the Beneficiary in violation of RCW 61,24,010. A  restraining order was issued and the Beneficiary DISCONTINUED the foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX. It was later ascertained that the order to DISCONTINUE the foreclosure sale was in response to action by the CFPB ( document III ).  The term DISCONTINUE is a legal term used in RCW 61.24.et seq. It clearly states that a DISCONTINUANCE is issued when the terms and conditions of the Deed of Trust have been met to the Beneficiarys satisfaction at least 11 days before the sale date. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I sued the Beneficiary and its Trustee for breaches of RCW 61.24.at seq. It wasnt until after the judge made the ruling that we discovered the attorney for the Beneficiary and Trustee had presented false documents in court, a CR -11, RCW 9A.72.020, and 18 USC 1621 violation ( documentation available IV ). I contacted the law offices of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( legal representative for both the Beneficiary and Trustee in this action ) and confronted the attorney with these facts that were confirmed by the State of Washington ( document V ). XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX agreed that no further foreclosure action would be taken, as it would call into question the validity of all notarized signatures presented and attested to their authenticity in court. 

From XX/XX/XXXX to the present, there were numerous communications that occurred between the myself and representatives of PNC, In those communications PNC representatives stated numerous times, in writing and in recorded telephone conversations, that the Beneficiary was unaware of any activity that occurred prior to PNC becoming the Servicer of the loan in late XX/XX/XXXX, or any agreements that were reached verbally with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

After filing papers in court to DISCONTINUE the foreclosure on XX/XX/XXXX, the Beneficiary then attempts for the third time to foreclose on the property on XX/XX/XXXX, approximately two and a half years after filing the Discontinuance. PNC, ( now the Servicer AND Beneficiary ) allegedly hired, XXXX XXXX as its attorney and XXXX XXXX XXXX as the Successor Trustee, in XX/XX/XXXX ( document VI ). 


COMPLAINT : PNC, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) as Successor Trustee, and its attorney XXXX XXXX have violated numerous sections of the RCW. To be brief, as this is not a complete list : 1 ) RCW 61.24.010 ( 2 ) The Beneficiary has appointed three Successor Trustees without any of them resigning. This statute gives the procedures for replacing the trustee. It gives specific instructions on documents that must be filed, including a document titled Resignation of Trustee ( RT ). The significance of the RT is it represents the surrendering of the originals of the Deed of Trust, Promissory Note, and Title back their original possessor. 

2 ) RCW 61.24.010 ( 3 ). Under this statute, the Successor Trustee can not have a Fiduciary Obligation to the Beneficiary. However, XXXX mailed a letter via USPS dated on or about XX/XX/XXXX, in which XXXX clearly states that they are a Debt Collector for the Beneficiary. 

3 ) RCW 61.24.020 XXXX and XXXX share the same address, office and phone number. This calls into question the separation between the Beneficiarys attorney ( XXXX ) and the Successor Trustee ( XXXX  ). This calls into question whether the Successor Trustee could operate in an impartial manner. 

4 ) RCW 61.24.030 ( 7 ) a The Beneficiarys claim was disproved in its letter on XX/XX/XXXX when it stated that the signature on the promissory note did not match the signature on the officially issued government identification. The notary process was also fatally flawed, which was communicated to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. 

5 ) RCW 61.24.030 ( 7 ) b XXXX violated this statute when it declared that they were a Debt Collector and therefore had a Fiduciary Obligation to the Beneficiary. 

6 ) RCW 61.24.030 ( 8 ) The Beneficiary or Trustee is required to send a document attesting that the Beneficiary is in possession of the Promissory Note, via USPS registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. The Beneficiary or Trustee did neither, as sending the document via USPS would have been in violation of 18 USC 1341 : Frauds and Schemes, since they were aware that the note was specious.

7 ) RCW 61.24.et seq A Discontinuance of a foreclosure is the attestation by the Beneficiary that the default ( s ) have been cured and the Trustees fees and costs are paid. In this case, the Beneficiarys current attorney ( XXXX ) has claimed ignorance of this Discontinuance of Trustee Sale and the legal ramifications of that action. 

8 ) From the XX/XX/XXXX internal email evidence obtained through discovery for my lawsuit against the Beneficiary and the Successor Trustee, their employees received the message We are instructed to Cancel our sale on all CFPB Holds that are requested by our client. 
Another crucial communication occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, sent from the Successor Trustee to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to please provide a copy of the Notice of Discontinuance of Sale. Our attorney needs it for our defense docs in a litigation action. 
Was this yet ANOTHER litigation involving my mortgage or was the Discontinuance of the foreclosure on our home part of the settlement to reduce the Federal fine for PNC? Once that reduced fine was levied from CFPB, DoJ, SEC, the Federal Reserve, and/or Office of the Comptroller, etc., did the Beneficiary then wait for sufficient time to elapse to RESTART the foreclosure process in hopes they were no longer under scrutiny ; no Federal agency would be monitoring them ; and documentation could be conveniently misplaced, as evidenced by the lack of pass along documentation admitted by the Beneficiarys attorney ( XXXX ) in the XX/XX/XXXX mediation. 
As the email of XX/XX/XXXX uses the plural tense it can be surmised that this was happening in more than one of the Beneficiarys foreclosures. According to press reports there were thousands of botched foreclosures.

Conclusion : From this initial review of the Laws of the State of Washington, no doubt there are other violations that can be sited. In the State of Washington, there have been approximately 400 foreclosures by XXXX in the last 8 months that may not be in  compliance with RCW 61.24.et seq. Other states undoubtedly have similar laws on their books.

I told them that is was a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act Section 168b ( c ) and that it was a serious breach of my privacy rights.

Then XXXX XXXX  came back and said they could do it we were charged an additional {$1400.00} XX/XX/XXXX. We called XXXX XXXX  about the excessive fees that we were being charged. They said that they would get an adjustment on the account. A credit of XXXX was added to our account that meant a balance of XXXX was added for upgraded seats and luggage. XXXX we had to cancel our flight due to the virus. Our trip was supposed to leave XX/XX/XXXX. We had also purchased travel insurance. We also purchased the price drop etc. after canceling our trip we filed a clean with cheapo air for the insurance to pay. Which they did not do. We also contacted capital one several times to block XXXX XXXX XXXX or anybody else charging onto our account. Which they told me several times I could not stop them from charging on my account. Filed complaints with capital one several times capital one not taking our side taking XXXX XXXX side. Saying we purchased tickets that were nonrefundable. When we purchased the tickets we were told that the insurance would pay if we had any problems due to health issues or whatever reason is what we were told. We also took the other three policies they had. Capital one was not there to stand by us at any time we spent numerous times on the phone with them. Capital one not sending us responses from frontier at all. How are you supposed to respond when you don't have all the information. Capital one was at fault many times and a manager that I spoke to in May saw that. She said capital one should eat this for all the problems that you have had and I see that we were at fault at not sending you all the information. Capital one continue to let XXXX XXXX charge on our card. After filing a XXXX XXXX XXXX claim against XXXX. Since you couldn't get them on the phone. Or they just didn't wan na respond to emails calls text, XXXX nothing. After XXXX responded to a XXXX XXXX XXXX complaint guess what I got a charge of {$590.00} on my capital one bill. This was for rescheduling a fee that might take place in the future. My family and I are three high risk people. Me I have XXXX and XXXX XXXX. My wife XXXX XXXX XXXX among other things. My mother-in-law the same issues we were told do not fly. So when I gave a tentative date to the XXXX XXXX XXXX it wasn't I was flying those days that was clear upfront. When XXXX Book the flight I said XX/XX/XXXX because the wedding was going to be the XXXX and XXXX. And my family is from New York we did not want to fly XX/XX/XXXX. For obvious reasons would've never of picked that day frontier came back to the XXXX XXXX XXXX and told them sorry we don't have any flights XX/XX/XXXX you'll have to leave XX/XX/XXXX. This is something that was not something that I would ever do my family would never ever ever do. But yet I was stuck in a hole capital one was not backing us up they continue to let frontier charge on my account card. XXXX continue to bill and book things that I never booked. Capital one said oh well they gave you credit for it I'm hello look at the numerous fees that we've paid up to this date let 's review XX/XX/XXXX {$660.00} XX/XX/190 XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX {$1400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$590.00}. For a grand total of {$2800.00}. Also XXXX XXXX has given us only {$1200.00} worth of airline credit. To our understanding the rest we have to eat because it's for fees of whatever kind. If capital one had turned over the paperwork numerous times we could maybe say what that {$1600.00} is for. But they didn't do that numerous times we've asked them let me speak to a manager they've hung up on us numerous times. When we did get a manager we asked for it to go over the managers had to MoveOn to escalate the problem. That was never done no paperwork was ever sent Nor was the problem escalated.

"To Whom It May Concern, I just received verbal confirmation that XXXX XXXX, Daughter, will be removed as an Authorized User on my Sear 's Credit Card, account number XXXX ( the Account ). It is my understanding that Sears intends to continue reporting the Account to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX on XXXX Credit Report, with the premise that she is not responsible for the balance. Unfortunately, although she is not responsible for the balance, I have written proof ( see attached ) that the existence of the Account and the related payment history ( that she is not responsible for ) is negatively impacting her credit score. XXXX is in the process of purchasing a home ; the negative impact ( lower credit score ) from reporting the Account on her Credit Report, will prevent her from qualifying for the Mortgage. Since she is not, and was never, responsible for the balance on the Account, I do not understand why Sears would report it to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX on her Credit Report in the first place? It is based on this premise and the proven negative impact the Account has on her Credit Score that I request that the Account be deleted immediately from any and all future reporting, on behalf of XXXX, to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. I would like written confirmation that this request has been submitted to XXXX, XXXX and XXXX and that in the interim, I would like it noted on my Account, immediately, that I authorize a responsible Representative, from Sears, to discuss this information openly with XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX.

"URGENT!! YOUR BILLING IS STILL WRONG!! 

Despite my prior complaints and correspondence, you ( Wells Fargo, N.A. ) continue to carry forward a principal balance that is at least {$20000.00} more than the actual amount owed. You continue to demand this as part of a balloon payment. This means you continue to calculate principal and interest amounts that are incorrectly calculated. Documentation was presented through CFPB and USPS Certified Mail. It is again attached hereto. 

You are not answering my questions about 1 ) how to comply and 2 ) specifics about the documents you are requesting. 

That is, you have not responded to my questions and concerns, only sent form letters, and a notification that you have now stopped the modification process, for which you once said I had qualified. You state I didnt meet your stated XX/XX/2020 deadline. However, my questions about the requested documents were sent well before that deadline, both through Certified Mail, as well as the CFPB. 

I wish to work with you on the modification as evidenced by my actions, application and submissions of detailed documents requested over the past year. Please consider this official continued notification of this position. 

I need more information to continue my compliance. I must know how and what you are requesting with more specificity. This information has not been provided. Faxing has proven an unreliable method of transmission, so I am forced to continue to file complaints due to your lack of specificity and demands for payment in what has been evidenced as an incorrect amount. I have reattached this evidence to this complaint. Also, in hopes that it will satiate your demands, my late husbands will and an affidavit related to the probate filing is also attached hereto, but your vague request for probate documents or ( where to send documents by mail ) remain undefined. 

My legal advisor states all of this continues in violationof the FDCPA. Please correct your billing and please stop making false claims that I have not complied with your set requirements. For you to ignore my questions while continuing to bill me is not fair. 

I am and have always been willing to make payments to you when provided channels to do so, as further evidenced by my last letter and CFPB complaint to you. Unfortunately, you continue to ignore and/or dismiss my questions about this ongoing issue, while moving forward with your demands for payment in full of what you claim is the amount due. I am still trying to comply as I still wish to keep my home and avoid foreclosure. 

Again, please tell me how and where to send the documents to continue the modification process ( detailed in my last letter ). We need this information to continue since the avenues you have supposedly provided along the way ( though dont mention in the last letter ) have proven unreliable.

"To Whom It May Concern : I am a new costumer with Caliber Home Loans and have experienced many issues with the mortgage company 's automatic payment system. There is a general lack of record keeping that is worrisome in such a way that the costumer can not view previous payments that have been posted or the financial transaction history. This has resulted in me having been double charged for a recent mortgage payment. In cases of automatic payments this is especially problematic. For example, for my mortgage payment in the month of XXXX, I had set up an automatic payment from my personal bank account. However, the costumer has no way of knowing whether a recent payment has been posted or is pending. Based on this, I made a payment manually. But the next day I had 2 payments posted back to back. Any other major credit systems have options that clearly display the next scheduled payment. Caliber does not.
The management team is also unresponsive. I have contacted Caliber Home Loans and asked to speak with supervisors many times. Their team members have told me that the company is notoriously bad at handling double payment charges and I should instead go through my personal bank to dispute the double charge. I have requested to speak with a supervisor, however, I have not been contacted by a manager and it has been two weeks since the incident.",Mortgage
"1. My vehicle was hit in XXXX XXXX, 2020 and declared at first "" Total Loss '' by the hitter 's insurance company, XXXX XXXX.

Therefore, the insurance company paid all repairing cost and the repair was completely done in XXXX. I also achieved the certificate of no mechanical error from the California State government-designated mechanics. 

2. I contacted the California DMV to renew the registration in May, but they said my car was still in salvage status that the Hyundai Motor Finance ( HMF ), the lender for my vehicle, should cancel salvage. The DMV also wanted me to bring a copy of title or lien. 

3. From XXXX, I have contacted HMF and they did not know how to handle this request from DMV. Their insufficient understanding of job knowledge dragged this problem until XXXX. Finally they wanted to receive the cancelation notice of total loss from the insurance company, XXXX XXXX and so XXXX emailed this notice to HMF 's total loss department on XXXX, 2020. Despite numerous contacts with HMF 's customer service which has required 30 to 90 minutes each time, they answered their computer did not show the receipt of notice and so wanted again another email from insurance co. The insurance company again sent an email to total loss dept. of HMF on XXXX XXXX. The insurance company always forwarded me their emails. 

4.Since XXXX XXXX, I have contacted the customer service five times to check if their total loss dept. received the notice from insurance co. However the customer service staff and their supervisor as well again did not know what was going on with their total loss dept. saying apology and asking to wait one or three days or a week. On XXXX XXXX, the supervisor, XXXX, wanted the insurance co. to fax the cancelation notice to their total loss dept. I repeated this ridiculous action asking the insurance co.to send again notice by fax. 

5. Due to failure to respond this simple request on time, the Cal DMV accrued the penalty. And I even was not able to drive this car since XXXX. 
That's why I sincerely look forward to the CFPB 's help in dropping the salvage and covering the loss of my time and DMV 's penalty by Hyundai Motor Finance.

"REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!! 
I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act.

Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary.

"I called Wells Fargo in XX/XX/XXXX because they were the transfer agent for XXXX XXXX. I owned XXXX  stock and needed to sell that stock to pay the mortgage. For two plus years Wells Fargo did not sell the stock. They did not respond to my sending them the paperwork necessary which they emailed to me and which I sent back to them overnight mail return receipt requested. That paperwork included a XXXX form filled out by XXXX XXXX XXXX. In spite of many telephone calls, Wells Fargo ignored my request to sell the stock. The XXXX stock was purchased by me over many years under their corporate plan where you purchase amounts of stock with no broker fees and they keep the certificates. When you are ready to sell the stock they have the certificates so they immediately sell the stock and you are supposed to be reimbursed as though you sold it yourself through a broker - which is a four day settlement period. 

After many telephone calls to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX - a group that did not respond to acknowledge receipt of the forms I sent for some two plus weeks - I discovered they could not find the forms I mailed to them overnight mail return receipt requested. I have the receipt signed by XXXX so  they received the papers in a timely fashion. 

Some several weeks after my initial call to XXXX - which was a second, third and fourth call to them, which calls were preceded by calls from my daughter before I made my initial call to Wells Fargo with no response. - She was told they could not talk to her - only to me. The stock was held in trust by me in the names of XXXX of my daughters. 

After two years and several months and dozens of telephone calls, letters, emails, and after my calls to the Massachusetts Attorney General 's office, the XXXX, the Securities and Exchange Comm. XXXX told me via telephone that they had sent my forms back to me because they were incorrectly filled out. 

I was a XXXX XXXX licensed with the XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX. In fact, I was the first XXXX XXXX so licensed in the United States. My background includes XXXX XXXX School and more and those forms are not that complicated. The XXXX form signed by the bank was the most important of the forms. 

I filled in more form and resent them to XXXX and again did not hear from them for over a month. Again, with the second set of forms the stock should have been transferred to my daughters names and sold. Again, nothing happened - no contact from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, - Again, no acknowledgement that they received the forms, as before, and again, no change in the stock. The first time I was told after more than a month and telephone calls during which they could not find the forms I mailed to them. This second time of sending them forms they simply ignored me. 

Finally, some two plus years later after much struggle which negatively affected my mortgage payments and my credit XXXX acknowledged receipt of forms from my daughter - a XXXX XXXX School graduate, lawyer, etc. - and agreed to put the stock certificates in my daughters names so they could execute them. 

All of these two plus years, Wells Fargo Mortgage was charging my mortgage account some {$140.00} per month in late fees because of the position they put me in and kept me in. So they had a motive for what they did and Wells Fargo benefitted at my expense. 

All during this time, I called the Wells Fargo Mortgage department, told them what was happening, made a complaint and received several conflicting responses - one from a Wells Fargo corporate lawyer which had nothing to do with the facts of what happened, but which were outlined in such a way that they attempted to justify what happened instead of responding to the actual problems they caused. Her response was totally to something, but not to the complaint I raised with the bank. It was as if she had a generated form she could send for any possibility and the facts of my complaint were ignored. She clearly either ignored the complaint and did her own thing or responded via a pre-computerized form over which she put my name - facts which pertained to what happened to me were irrelevant. 

Once that was resolved we immediately received letters from Wells Fargo threatening to put us in foreclosure because we were two months behind in the mortgage. 

They outlined a number of things I had to do to bring the mortgage current or face foreclosure. 

Wells Fargo was sending, on a monthly basis, an invoice which included the mortgage, mortgage interest and escrow for city real estate taxes. I called and then wrote to Wells Fargo telling them to stop collecting city real estate taxes because I talked to the City of XXXX and was going to pay the taxes directly to the city. Since I asked Wells Fargo a couple years ago to collect and pay the real estate taxes for me until I could work out whatever was wrong with the city of XXXX and the way they collected my real estate taxes. They agreed and I wanted to be sure I could stop this arrangement whenever I needed to do so. Wells Fargo assured me that was an accurate assumption. 

Now that I have requested they not escrow anymore real estate taxes, Wells Fargo has not done so and has demanded that I not only pay them the mortgage, interest and city taxes for the two months I was behind. 

They already had a substantial escrow account and I called to stop their collection of city taxes at a point where it would be convenient for them to do so because they would use the money escrowed to pay the taxes and I would take over from there. That was not to Wells Fargo 's liking. They got to collect city real estate taxes - which are substantial. They could hold the money for some six months each year before paying the taxes and that would accrue to Wells Fargo a nice amount of extra money. 

Wells Fargo had my account in "" Recovery '' and the "" Recovery '' people are quite messy and looking for everything they can get for Wells Fargo. The guy I spoke to said they had just paid the taxes and since I didn't have any money to reimburse them they were not going to stop collecting the taxes. I asked him about the escrow account and what happened to it and why that was not used - as had normally been done in the past - to more than cover the amount they paid. His response was he didn't know about an escrow account and would have to check it out. 

I called Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX to pay the mortgage and could not get through. The number I have to pay the mortgage - which is how my mortgage has always been paid, via telephone, did not have any knowledge of my mortgage account. It was as if we didn't exist. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I called back and was going to insist on being transferred to their executive offices, but that didn't seem necessary because the person I spoke to transferred me to this "" Recovery '' group. I tried to pay the mortgage due for XX/XX/XXXX and that was refused because I was paying the mortgage and interest, but not escrowing the city real estate taxes. They refused to accept my payment in spite of the fact that it was a full amount of the mortgage and mortgage interest. They would not accept payment for the mortgage without the escrow amount for the city taxes. At that point the escrow amount I had paid them previously for city taxes came to about {$6000.00} plus which was just sitting in an escrow account someplace within Wells Fargo. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX several times to pay the second months mortgage due and/or to pay both months at once if that was possible and was turned down. They would not take either the XX/XX/XXXX payment nor would they take the XX/XX/XXXX payment for the same reason they turned down the XX/XX/XXXX payment, nor would they take both at once until all payments included the escrow for city real estate taxes. 

I filed a complaint with the company in XX/XX/XXXX about all of this and was told the gentleman would call me back with some resolution from Wells Fargo by XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX my phone rang and when I answered there was no one on the other side. Since we have had many problems with our telephone service either that was the problem or Wells Fargo was playing games with my account. 

When I picked up the telephone which was ringing on XX/XX/XXXX with no one on the other end - just silence - because I saw Wells Fargo 's name on the caller ID and a telephone number I called that telephone number and a woman answered and said the gentleman who took my complaint was out of the office that day and a woman had placed a call to my telephone number to say the resolution would not come until XX/XX/XXXX instead of XX/XX/XXXX and she was at the time entering a note in my record at Wells Fargo that she tried to call me, let the phone ring for over a minute, no answering machine clicked on so she hung up. Very different from what actually happened on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I again reiterated to the person I spoke to that I tried to pay the mortgage - it was not accepted because of the city real estate taxes and I had checked and discovered that was something they could not do. They could insist the mortgage and interest amount be paid in full, but not include these other things. 

In addition, Wells Fargo collected {$160.00} more than the mortgage payment due many months ago and in spite of several telephone calls about that, including from my daughter, I could not get them to apply that money against anything. I called them several times and asked that it be used to reduce principle or reduce the next payment and they didn't do either. I received, recently, after the account was turned over to "" Recover '' a statement saying this amount had been collected in excess and what should they do with it. My response - put it to reduce principle or credit it against a mortgage payment - was again ignored and the money was not reimbursed to me in any form. 

When I paid the mortgage for several months I asked that it be less than the total amount due by {$160.00} and I was told that was not possible. when you call via telephone you are given an amount due and you pay that amount. For them to have collected {$160.00} in excess they gave me that amount as being due and insisted on collecting the mortgage amount due plus the {$160.00} with no explanation. I could either pay the amount being quoted to me as due over the telephone or they could not accept my money. 

I also notice that recently I was charged an additional {$.00} in the same way. That is not a large amount, but multiplied by the thousands of people for whom Wells Fargo collects mortgage money that accumulated figure is a very large amount. 

I am sitting with the arrears from the mortgage - an arrears caused by XXXX - and they are and have refused to accept any amounts from me. So they are doing in the mortgage area what they did in the stock transfer area - creating a circumstance under which they can benefit and under which they can attempt to move to put my house in foreclosure. 

I would appreciate your investigating this complaint.",Mortgage

"To Whom It May Concern : A system error has resulted in a negative credit report that I hope to get amended. 
I leased my car in XX/XX/XXXX and was making timely payments through XXXX ' own online auto-pay function. All payments were credited on time with no issue. An internal error resulted in two payments being pulled for XX/XX/XXXX. Subsequently, I suspended the XX/XX/XXXX payment.

There was absolutely no email, phone or written contact by XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received the first contact from XXXX that my payments were now late. Immediately the balance was cancelled and set up to date. Unfortunately, despite not receiving a call, email or letter prior to this my credit report was negatively impacted. I reached out directly to XXXX to attempt to clarify the situation but they were no help. 

Once my records are reviewed you will notice I have worked very diligently to make timely and responsible payments and maintain a clean credit report.

"I am writing this email to express my profound discontent with how XXXX XXXX XXXX is handling the public service loan forgiveness program. 

Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I was informed that I do not qualify for PSLF because my loans are FFELP loans. This information was provided to me after calling in because I received a vague notice informing me that my employment certification was denied, without the reason why. 

Today was the 6 time this year that I called XXXX XXXX XXXX   regarding PSLF. Years ago I had also contacted them regarding PSLF and I was never told that my loans were FFELP loans. Additionally, my loan servicer AES never told me that my loans are FFELP loans even after I called them to be placed on an income driven repayment plan for PSLF years ago. Furthermore, under the loan detail section of their website for my loans it does NOT say the type of loan that I have, whether direct or FFELP. Instead of the information of the loan type being available on the website, what is available is the loan program ( Subsized consolidation loan ). 

The representative from XXXX XXXX XXXX said that I would have to consolidate my loans which would have be eligible since XX/XX/XXXX if it weren't for their loan type and the fact that eventhough I called in several times over the years to both XXXX XXXX XXXX and AES I was never told my loan type of FFELP did not qualify. 

My plan was to apply for the Temporary expanded public service loan forgiveness since I had been on the graduate extended repayment plan for the majority of my loan payment and 2 years on the standard plan. 

I find it unfair and unjust to not have my employment certification form denied only because of the loan type, especially when it can be converted into a direct loan by consolidation. The problem here is that consolidation erases the 10 years of payments.",Student loan

I had to call around trying to find it when I spoke with 21st mortgage they sounded like the understood what I was looking for but then called me back and said they didn't understand what I was asking. When they sent my documents over to XXXX who bought my mortgage they sent their homeowners insurance so they would be paid instead of the correct one. The whole experience was horrible and drained me of all my savings. They knew what they needed in the beginning but drew it out two months longer then it should.

"In XX/XX/2019, I sent Experian a request to delete an inaccurate account on my credit report. I sent screenshots showing that is reporting differently to each of the 3 bureaus. In XX/XX/2019, they sent back a response that they updated the account. However, the account was still reporting differently than the other bureaus. 

In XX/XX/2019, I sent another letter, again with screenshots included of the inaccurate reporting. In XX/XX/2019, they sent another response again saying that the account was updated. My frustration is as follows : 1. How is each bureau properly investigating if they are all reporting differently?

2. How can Experian report that I was 60 days past due, but the prior month, I have a payment status of "" OK ''. How can I be 60 days past due when I wasn't 30 days past due the month prior.

3. How can an account be charged off if is not 180 days past due? The 2 months prior to the charge off status, Experian is reporting "" OK '' for payment status.

4. Why do they have no data for XX/XX/2019?

5. In the account history, the Actual payment for XX/XX/2019 shows {$100.00}, but they are reporting my recent payment as {$40.00}. 

6.

"ATTENTION XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Eventhough XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX was the Originating Servicers in XXXX when this loan/mortgage was created, the company ( XXXX ) is touting that they sold you [ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ] the mortgage in XXXX. ( See XXXX attached copy ). And wants to eliminate themselves from the Wrongful Acts that they carried out in ( XXXX and XXXX ) because they stated that you were sold the loan in ( XXXX ). ( See all information in this complaint ). So I am sending your company [ XXXX XXXX XXXX ] the complaint ( which I thought the CFPB sent you already ). 
The below information explains in further detail of what was requested of ( XXXX XXXX Servicing , LLC ) in the previous complaint that was not remotely or respectively answered. Amongst many other questions that should have been answered and Corrections that should ( should have ) been made. See CFPB # XXXX. 
In XXXX while originating our loan application, you, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX Circumvented the Florida Law reference A Borrower and A Married Borrower in the State of Florida. Which forms a [ Tenancy by the Entireties ] which treats the husband and wife as a unit. In the State of Florida, any Real Property or Personal Property held by husband and wife as ( tenants by the entireties ) belongs to neither spouse individually, but rather each spouse owns the whole property. And both signatures are required for any change in document terms ( i.e. Loan Modification Agreements ). 
You ( XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) made my husband ( the Sole loan borrower ) on the loan application of your own volition, instead of the both of us on the application form. Which there should not have been any reason we couldnt qualify together. But even so, because we are a married unit, the Florida Law did not call for your company to dictate Spousal Rights ( in favor of my husband ) over our Real Property. ( i.e. telling me I need permission to discuss my real property with you ( XXXX ) or/and ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) or any other entity ( i.e. CFPB ). 
It was Reckless, and Manipulative to further circumvent the Florida Law to create your own rules to [ exploit Rights of Power to discuss any business regarding our real property to my husband ] and simultaneously created a wall shielding the Spousal ( WIFE ) from being able to ( Call Your Servicing Company/ XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX mortgage/servicing ) to discuss any business matters in reference to our investment property. 
That was, and still is a Reckless, Destructive Act that could cause Severe Problems regarding property asset distribution between a Husband and Wife in this State. But ultimately, you ( XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) broke the Florida Law regarding Spousal Property Ownership by ( thru loan years ) have continuously invalidated my position as a ( titled married owner of our Real Property ). 

RESPONSE TO XXXX XXXX XXXX STATMENT # 1 Answer Per you ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) Tout of me being unauthorized to receive/request information reference my own property. You ( XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) broke the Florida Law between Married Property Owners. As stated in the above paragraphs, it is Destructive and Reckless for you, XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) to have Circumvented the Florida Law ( during the application process ) to benefit your application needs. 
The decision regarding the form of ownership of an asset is Critically Important, especially in the State of Florida. So this Act of exploiting Sole Rights of Power to my Husband [ in the State of Florida ] can cause extreme detriment in regards to spousal laws relating to real property, etc. 

# 2 Answer In reference to ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) stating they transferred our loan to ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ). The main area of this complaint surrounds the ( Modification Agreement ) Originated by you ( XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) in XXXX for processing a contract agreement consisting of [ One married partys signature [ my husband ] and did not contain the ( other married Partys signature ) the ( spousal wife ), which makes the Modification Agreement unenforceable. ( Invalid ). 
There were changes made to the existing contract by extending the terms of the Maturity Date to ( XX/XX/XXXX ). I the ( other owner/spouse ) did not agree to these terms ( neither was my signature on the Modification Agreement ). I am requesting the [ Maturity Date is Corrected ) according to the Original Promissory Note to ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 
Also, there is a ( XXXX letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  attached ) that states from XXXX XXXX XXXX that they were servicing our Loan ( at that time ) on behalf of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, [ WHO IS ACTUALLY THE MASTER SERVICER ]. ( see attached letter ) Note/Attachments : A letter from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  is attached regarding authorization of ( the spousal wife ) discussing our Investment Real Property. Which is against Florida Law for ( XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX ) to exercise and expedite those Financial Rules, and to other Mortgage Companies/Servicers, etc. that XXXX conducts business with. 
Also, a copy of the ( Invalid Modification Loan Agreement ( with the signature of one Party ). Which I also sent with previous complaint to XXXX. 
There is approximately ( 5 ) already other uploaded documents regarding this complaint under CFPB # XXXX.

Account Name XXXX XXXX Reason : You failed to verify and validate all data for this account, every notation, dates and balances. This account needs to be removed IMMEDIATELY via FCRA section 609. 

Ive submitted enough information regarding the fraudulent account thats open in my name I have provided information for your company to have carried out a reasonable investigation of this dispute. If you had investigated properly rather then using your e-Oscar system you would have noticed that this account is not mine which your companies have claimed to Verified. Since youve obviously neglected to investigate this account thoroughly I am demanding you remove this account off my profile. It is at this time that I will point out the in Cushman v TransUnion, Stevenson v. TRW ( Experian ), and Richardson v. Fleet, Equifax et, the courts ruled each and every time that the CRA couldnt merely Parrot information from the creditors and collection agencies that they have conduct an independent REASONABLE investigation to ensure the validity of the debt and honesty/integrity of the creditors/CA in question. Sending out a generic form through the e-Oscar system that doesnt even contain my reasons for the dispute is not reasonable. 

If you dont initiate an investigation regarding my dispute, as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. Which Im sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court. 
I look forward to an expedite resolution of this matter Thank you.

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NJ XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX To : PRMG Paramount residential Mortgage Group INC. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Loan # XXXX Dear Sir/ Madam As you knew that I refinanced my loan with XXXX XXXX for better interest rate and lower monthly mortgage payment, this refinance done by Paramount Residential Mortgage Group INC under LOAN # XXXX. Contact Tel Number XXXX Fax XXXX. 
The above mortgage company sold my loan number XXXX to one of their corporation partner PRMG Paramount residential Mortgage Group INC. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX New Loan Number is Loan # XXXX. 
A- I paid the previous mortgage loan company my mortgage through XX/XX/XXXX B- My monthly mortgage payment was {$2600.00} as I signed my closing mortgage documents. 
C- I paid extra principal since mortgage started after refinance through XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$3500.00} XXXX with an extra principal payment. 

D- My 1st due month for PRMG Paramount residential Mortgage Group INC . 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, NJ XXXX Loan # XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX E- Please see attached documents # 1 mortgage statement for XX/XX/XXXX, statement date XX/XX/XXXX. The statement showed my amount due is {$2600.00}. 
F- You can see also the following statement dated on XX/XX/XXXX showed that the amount due for XX/XX/XXXX is {$2600.00}. 
G- On XX/XX/XXXX I was able to find better insurance company ( XXXX XXXX ), my total annual premium became {$1200.00} to take effect XX/XX/XXXX. Comparing with my previous insurance company policy annual premium was {$1700.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Policy # XXXX. 
H- The above mortgage company paid both insurance companies even after I notified them in massage that the Policy # XXXX has been cancelled on XX/XX/XXXX. They paid the amount of {$1700.00} XXXX and {$1200.00} for XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
I- I learned from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX they will refund the full amount of the policy premium to me directly ( NOT TO MY MORTGAGE COMPANY ). Therefore I issued full refund to the mortgage company in the amount of {$1700.00} XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX off my personal bank account pay bill services. It was noted on the memo { escrow refund }. 
J- Unfortunately the above mortgage company applied the amount to the principal balancer NOT TO THE ESCROW ACCOUNT Balance! 
K- Once I noticed the company error I sent notice online explaining the error and requested the correction to reduce the overcharge escrow balance shortage. But up to XX/XX/XXXX nothing done yet! 
L- I received on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX the attached Escrow summery showed that the annual expected to pay insurance {$1600.00} ( this number never listed in any documents for any of both insurance company ) Expected to pay {$1200.00} .Also Taxes {$7000.00} expected to pay {$7600.00} PLEASE SEE ATTCHED DOCUMENTS # 3 THROUGH # 5. 
M- Based on the attached XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXted XX/XX/XXXX ( PLEASE SEE ATTACHED DOCUMENTS NUMBER FROM # 7 TO # 10. 
The City annual Property tax on page # 9 top right line # 10 that TOTAL ANNUAL NET PROPERTY TAX IS {$7000.00}.

N- Also please see attached document # 11 from the XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX that the XXXX annual property tax was {$7000.00}. 
O- Also please see attached document # 12 property information that the annual XXXX tax is {$7000.00}. 
P- Also please see attached documents from # 13 to # 16 shows the due date for each quarter including the amount due each quarter. 
Based On the above documents, I contacted your customer services several time concerning about wrong charge on my escrow account but ended by a female representative all what she wants is to end the call and she was even unhappy to look on her computer to verify my request, however I requested to speak with other person she said ok and end my call. Then I have to call back and I spoke with another mail worker who was able to contact his supervisor to sent massage to escrow department to correct their error. 
The following is explanation how is the PRMG escrow department done not calculated the escrow amount correct L : 1- The account sold to the above mortgage company from Loan # XXXX to Loan # XXXX with escrow credit balance amount {$2900.00} ( was deducted of my refinance case out payment ). The previous mortgage company sold the loan and paid all what they collected under loan # XXXX to the new mortgage company.

2- Based on the city of XXXX XXXX annual property taxes XXXX is {$7000.00}. 
( PRMG ESCROW SUMMERY CALCULATED PROPERTY TAXES {$7600.00} ). This caused an extra wrong collection amount of {$580.00} under property taxes.

3- XXXX XXXX amount of {$1700.00} XXXX was refunded to the mortgage company.

4- That is means there was no shortage on escrow account.

5- The XXXX XXXX payment of {$1200.00} was part of the monthly mortgage payments calculations. Means there was no extra payment especially when the policy premium reduced from {$1700.00} to {$1200.00} ( means the monthly payment should be less not extra ).

6- If you add the following math problem you will find that I am correct according to the documents and calculations : Annual property tax {$7000.00} + property Insurance {$1200.00} = {$8300.00} ( TOTAL ANNULA ESCROW ) / 12 MONTH = {$690.00}.

PRMG ESCROW DEPARTEMT FOUND ON ESCROW SUMMERY THE MONTHLY ESCROW AMOUNT IS {$740.00} MEANS EXTRA MONTHLY OVER CHARGE COLLECTION AMOUNT {$48.00} Please Be advised that I tried all methods and ways through email, your system login massages and several phone calls but was no progress until now, I have all hope to explain to me why that error happen in writing and readjust the escrow according to actual city of XXXX XXXX NJ property taxes and actual net property owner insurance.

XXXX 's response to my dispute did not address my concerns. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX continues to misreport 6 accounts on my report. The reporting shows that these accounts were 90 days late on XXXX of XXXX. It is not possible to be 90 days late, without first having a 30 day late, a 60 day late and then a 90 day late. The FCRA requires a furnisher to verify the validity of the item within 30 days. If the validity can not be verified, you are obligated by law to remove the inaccurate information. 

There were six certified mail letters with tracking numbers listed below, and thus six opportunities for them to fix the errors. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Attached is a copy of the six inaccurate accounts reporting on my credit file. 

In light of the recent court case opinion No. XXXX XXXX by the US Court of Appeals XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the court ruled that the creditor has the responsibility to investigate and make sure that correct information is being reported to the bureaus, and that the consumer has a right to sue under the FCRA, should his or her rights be violated. 

While I prefer not to litigate, I will use the courts as needed to enforce my rights under the FCRA. 

Furthermore the response XXXX sent to me dated XX/XX/XXXX stated Attached is the payment history of your 50 most recent transactions. This did not address my dispute of the 90 day late reporting that supposedly occurred on XXXX of XXXX. I did not ask for a recent payment history. I am disputing the inaccurate reporting that occurred on XXXX of XXXX. What I expected to received was documentation showing such lates and an accurate reporting of what transpired. In addition the 50th most recent transactions provided by XXXX did not include the transactions around the XX/XX/XXXX time frame and was therefore completely and utterly useless ; and therefore leads me to believe once again that XXXX did not read my dispute and certainly didn't address my concerns or the damage to my credit file. XXXX response states that this delinquency occurred prior to the forbearance but again provided no evidence, nor did they provide an explanation as to how the 90 day late report can appear on my file with no corresponding 60 or 30 day late. 

In their second letter responding to me also dated XX/XX/XXXX they state as follows : Although a deferment or forbearance applied to your account resolved your past-due status, the delinquency reporting you want removed occurred prior to the deferment or forbearance start date. Therefore, the delinquency information was accurately reported to the consumer reporting agencies. 

In the above statement XXXX continues to confirm that the reporting is correct, which as I've clearly mentioned in my dispute how is it possible to report 90 days late, without first being 30 days late, then 60 days late and then 90. My dispute is in regards to the accuracy of what they are reporting. XXXX was in receipt of my dispute on XX/XX/XXXX ; they've had well over the 30 days as required by the FCRA and per Nevada law to fix this reporting and have failed to do so. I request removal of the inaccurate 90 day late reporting from my credit reports as outlined in the FCRA.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

Before making my XX/XX/XXXX credit card payment, I called XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure I understood when my XXXX statement would close so that I did not use my balance sooner than it would be reported.

I called to discuss with XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  because I had called to confirm this with a representative on XX/XX/XXXX solely for the purpose of avoiding this sort of issue. They said they listened to the recorded call however they do not feel I was "" XXXX '' during the call.

Wells Fargo I responded : I have no idea what you are referring to. I did not state I was traveling in XXXX. None of what you referred to was in the email I sent you. 
I received a wire transfer from the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX in Yen. There was no ATM involved. There was no travel to XXXX. There was no purchase made. I was told by my branch manager in XXXX XXXXXXXX there would only be a {$15.00} wire transfer fee to receive money from the XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. 
No other fees were mentioned. 

They responded by giving me a case # XXXX and saying they would look into it. And they would get back to me in 10 days. 
XX/XX/XXXX Called Foreign Currency Department XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX in XXXX XXXX. 
I spoke with XXXX XXXX about the rate of exchange. 
We spoke for over 30 minutes about how Wells Fargo deals with converting yen to dollars.

He told me various scenarios of how the bank puts the yen I received with other orders of yen to amass large amounts and then converts them.

I spent over 30 minutes asking XXXX XXXX what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to when deciding when during a day of, ( his words ), "" wildly fluctuating exchange rates, '' which they would use. Obviously, for me they used the largest Yen to dollar rate and I lost {$16000.00}. 
I questioned him to relate to me what rules Wells Fargo has to adhere to about when and at what rate my yen gets converted. 
He told me that the amount of yen I received was small. I said I disagreed. 
XXXX XXXX said my amount transferred wasnt high enough to warrant a better rate. 
He said that day XX/XX/XXXX the rate fluctuated wildly from XXXX Yen per dollar to XXXX Yen per dollar. I obviously got the high Yen to Dollar rate to benefit Wells Fargo. 
He began to tell me when the amount in question was between {$100000.00} - {$500000.00}, that wasnt enough to warrant a better rate. 
I told him he was incorrect. He tried to repeat himself and then said he was wrong. The amount was close to {$800000.00} if the lowest yen to dollar amount was used for that day when the transfer was complete. 

I thanked XXXX XXXX for his help and said that I was unsatisfied with the explanation and with Wells Fargo Bank and wished I had never used them in this transaction. I said that my confidence in their treatment of my account was severely changed and that doing future business with them was impacted negatively. I added that I hoped a manager or boss of XXXX XXXX would review my complaint. 
He said they would. 
The whole conversation was recorded. 


XX/XX/XXXX Wrote a secure email to Wells Fargo saying that the difference between what $ were deposited in my account and the conversion rate for that day was over {$16000.00} I said I had lost faith in Wells Fargo to deal fairly and wanted answers. 

Here is the email : Reference # XXXX. I have not heard back from you concerning my wire transfer from the XXXX XXXX  XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative who responded to my original email request for an explanation of the conversion of yen to U.S dollars gave atartlingly incorrect and lengthy explanation of traveling and purchasing items in XXXX and the fees involved. I have no faith in Wells Fargo to have handle my simple wire transfer ethically and with a mind to keeping my business. 
The rate of exchange for that day was XXXX yen to {$1.00}. XXXX Yen/ {$1.00} XXXX Yen = {$800000.00} On my Wells Fargo account the conversion is only for {$780000.00}. The difference is {$16000.00}. Wells Fargo charged me a huge amount of money for something. You either charged me for a purchase I did not make, a use of funds in a manner that did not happen, fees that were not disclosed to me or a far worse conversion rate of yen to dollars. 

I need a response.

XXXX Yen / {$1.00} XXXX Yen = XXXX I want to lodge a formal complaint starting with Wells Fargo Bank officials. 
I think they used the worst possible conversion rate on that day and somehow covered up the real transaction amount by compiling my funds with other funds, converting them for more U.S. dollars and then hiding the actual transfer in paperwork I am not privy to. The amount they gave me in my account was the worst possible rate fro that day and they profited on my Yen transfer because no one is keeping tabs on their movement of funds and conversions.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.

I searched the Wells Fargo Website on my online account for any information on wire transfer regulations and found nothing. I searched for the general terms and agreements on my account and found nothing. I searched for terms and agreements on currency conversions and found nothing. There is no way I could have understood the conditions of receiving the Yen into my bank account. The manager of the Wells Fargo XXXX XXXXXXXX branch did not direct me to read any terms and conditions. I informed her of the upcoming wire transfer in Yen and all she told me was that it would be a {$15.00} fee no matter how much Yen was transferred. I asked if the bank performed any special tasks to receive the funds and she said no that the bank received millions of large transfers daily and that there was nothing special for me to do or know. 
Wells Fargo did not inform me of the conversion rate before they applied it. 
They are known for fraudulently setting up accounts in people 's names that did not request those accounts. Now, I believe they make fraudulent conversions of foreign wire transfers and mix up the paper trail to cover their manuevers.

Furthermore, in all discussions ( or attempted discussions ) they did not return scheduled calls. I was constantly pushed towards forbearance and when I inquired about loan forgiveness, they said I didn't qualify. 
I was forced to give up XXXX due to a XXXX  case of XXXX XXXX/XXXX   that prevented me from doing many things especially XXXX. This was communicated to the loan administrators although it made no difference. In XX/XX/XXXX, my husband ( who I married well after I had taken out the student loans was diagnosed with late XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. The XXXX had spread to his XXXX requiring the XXXX of XXXX XXXX in his XXXX XXXX and XXXX him XXXX. My husband is unable to earn an income. We are relying on Medicaid and have recently completed paperwork to qualify for SNAP and cash advances. 

I have had to become his XXXX XXXX XXXX and since he has been placed in XXXX I am no longer allowed to work ( under federal law ) or he will lose his insurance. When he lost his job, we were forced to take Medicaid. Our only source of income is a small Social Security Retirement of $ XXXX/month and a Medical Pension he receives from XXXX of around $ XXXX/month depending on the exchange rate  for a total of $ XXXX. We have had to sell items and rely on family to survive. No matter what discussion we held with Navient, they were simply not interested in knowing nor understanding they could not base his XXXX payments on a school loan payment for MY loan. IF I were to die, my spouse can NOT be held legally liable for these loans. I have, for years now, tried to play by their screwed up fake rules. I have called their customer service number too many times to count only to listen to a pre-recorded message that says to follow the prompts, choose the time and date when I would be available to receive a call back. So I would follow THEIR prompts schedule an appointment and wait with my phone in hand to receive a call ... .THEY NEVER CALLED! My full time "" job '' now is to care for my husband. Physically, it is very demanding. When I have XXXX  with XXXX XXXX, and my husband has doctor appointments, I have to rely on friends to drive him to his appointments because I am unable. Physically, I will never be able to return to the classroom to teach. 
I am in no position to be able to make any form of payment to Navient and this plea has simply been ignored on numerous occasions. 

I have written to my Ohio Representative, Mr. XXXX. He contacted Navient and they responded with a letter. I was NOT writing my congressman to ask about "" requesting information to repay my loan ''. I wrote him to explain how their deceitful policies and misguided information along with our catastrophic health issue with my husband will not allow me to repay these loans. I also explained to Congressman XXXX that I didn't believe it was fair NOR ethical that Federal Congress people and their families, if they have ever filed bankruptcy for an illness or job loss, they ARE allowed complete student loan forgiveness. They also claimed in the letter they'd "" attempted '' to contact me numerous times. ( NONSENSE! ) They can't even return a PRE-SCHEDULED call generated from THEIR system.",Student loan

"On XX/XX/2019 XXXX according to the company ), I purchased a {$500.00} Visa Gift Card from a local grocery store in the XXXX XXXX. I never got around to giving the card to the intended recipient, and I forgot I even had it until I had to move out of my apartment. Seeing the card, I opened it from its packaging and tried to use it on a trip I'm currently on. The card was declined. I called the number on the back of the card, thinking maybe it needed to be activated before I could use it. I was shocked to learn that a purchase had already been made at a XXXX XXXX grocery store in XXXX, CA, in the amount of {$490.00} on XXXX. That's only 4 days after I purchased the card. XXXX is roughly XXXX miles away from where I was that day, and {$490.00} is an unusually large purchase for a neighborhood grocery store -- and it is remarkably close to the {$500.00} limit of the card, which isn't printed anywhere. The company said the card was physically swiped at the location. 

I told the company that I did not make the purchase, and they said that their policies state that I only have 60 days to dispute a transaction. I was not made aware of any such policies, terms or conditions when I purchased the card, and while there is a legal-looking document, it's packaged with the card in its gift package. The only way to know about it is to tear open the gift packaging, which the purchaser ( me ) would never do if they intended to give the card to someone as a gift, which is its intended purpose. Also, the card number is obfuscated by the gift packaging, so even if I did know about the terms and conditions, I'd have to either give the card to someone within 60 days of purchasing it, or I'd again have to remove the card from its packaging so that I could get its number, and then monitor its use until giving it away as a gift. Who would want to receive an opened gift card as a present?? 

I've been emailing back and forth with the company for about a week now, but they keep refusing to do anything. They keep referring me back to their terms and conditions, despite my repeated explanations that I had no way of knowing such terms existed until removing the card from its packaging. They say that because so much time has passed, that they have no way of recovering the fraudulently used funds. I'm a XXXX XXXX, and I know these cards can be cloned if sufficient information about it is made available. Given how quickly it was used after I purchased it, the size of the purchase at a local grocery store ( and in a city that's known for criminal activity ), and the amount being so close to the card 's limit, all being made in a single transaction, I have no doubt that the company that makes these cards had some sort of data breach, and someone had access to the information about this ( and probably many other ) card so that they could not only clone it, but also know to only use it after the original card had been purchased by a legitimate consumer. This sort of data protection is the responsibility of the card issuer, not mine, so their inability to recover the stolen funds should not be my problem. 

As said, I've tried to work with the company, but they keep saying the same thing. I've also threatened to report the incident to consumer protection agencies, but that has not encouraged them to take any further action, and they say they are closing the dispute.",Credit card or prepaid card

It was a battle from day one and the building did nothing to help settle nor resolve the issues I was forced to leave and left with a rent debt that i believed we did not owe due to the circumstances. Simultaneously that year I was the guarantor of my mother XXXX XXXX lease at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NY XXXX. Both buildings were owned by the same company. 
Unfortunately, in 2016 My mother XXXX XXXX and iI lost my job. As stated above, we moved out of the apartment ( and state ). The landlord sued me and my wife. I could not afford an attorney and could not represent myself properly. They took a judgment against me and my wife. From that point on, Fair Collections undertook an aggressive phone and mail campaign to collect the debt they claimed they purchased from the Landlord, Not only did Fair Collections harass me, they called relatives, forma work locations, my guarantor, family members, and any other person or locations they believed I was located. It was daily and constant, multiple times daily. It was awful. I desperately tried to negotiate and hold them off but to no avail. They simply would not listen and applied high pressure tactics. They threatened my apartment guarantor and harassed him ( and his family ) to the point were he paid {>= $1,000,000} to Fair Collections to leave him and his family alone and resolve his potential liability. 
Despite collecting {$15000.00}, Fair Collections continued the harassment.

Today I attempted again only to be told I could pay a total of {$22000.00} to resolve both debts. More importantly, the representative said that even if i paid they would not remove it from our credit reports but would simply mark the matter resolved for a lesser amount. I explained I simply did not have anything near that amount and was still out of work. I explained I had a friend who could lend me a few thousand to resolve the matter. I explained that the debts reporting is destroying our credit and not allowing my family to move forward. The agent simply said no and that they would continue to hit my credit ( as they just did this month ) I simply do not understand how they can continue to pursue debts that are improper, debts they have collected on already. debts they contuse to use to destroy our credit, and debts they will not reasonably try to resolve considering the circumstances.",Debt collection

"My letter to XXXX  & US Bank. 


To Whom It May Concern, Im writing to inform you that your partner US Bank is an absolute joke and a crooked entity as a whole! Yes Im aware that most credit card companies fall into this category but at least others are working with me. Im completely shocked that an amazing company like XXXX continues to partner with US Bank. The short version of my story is this. The government tells me I have to stay home because of a pandemic labeled COVID-19. I'm not unreasonable so I get it but I'm forced to stay home and now I can't work. My place of employment was also forced to close its doors until further notice. Being a responsible citizen I attempted to contact all of my creditors. I sat on hold for countless hours over a period of weeks trying to reach all of my creditors and most of them were for the most part sympathetic with the exception of a few. One of them was US BANK. ZERO UNDERSTANDING! ZERO HELP! ZERO COMPASSION! ZERO COMMON SENSE REASONING! In short they said "" I'M SORRY SIR. WE'RE NOT OFFERING ANY ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT! ALL MONTHLY PAYMENTS ARE STILL DUE EVERY MONTH! '' I reiterated that I'm being forced to stay home and I have no income. They didn't care. Shortly after I received a letter stating that they're going to close my account and report me to the credit bureaus if I don't make a payment soon. I said, I'm sorry because feeding my family comes first so I will not be able to make a payment at the moment so do whatever you need to do. I just checked my credit report and they in fact did report me to all the major credit bureaus for being late. Its so sad that we have such failed system of checks and balances all controlled by greed. The system is designed to fail the average US citizen ( s ). Even the RESPONSIBLE US citizen ( s ) ... 

In addition, months prior I took out a loan to pay off a {$17000.00} balance on my XXXX  US BANK MC. My plan was too pay off the credit card and do a balance transfer from my other cards over to my US bank card in order to get a leg up on my finances. Mind you I had no prior issues and a perfect payment history. I discovered that a few weeks after I paid off the {$17000.00}, US BANK dropped my credit limit from {$17000.00} to {$2000.00} screwing me and my family over. I could have used that money instead to pay off my other cards if I knew they were going to do this. My family had a long overdue vacation that was planned that we had to cancel. I was going to book a vacation through XXXX  vacations and use the XXXX  MasterCard to get my dividend points. Im beyond angry. US Bank messed with my life, my families life and our livelihood. I know theres countless others that are experiencing the same thing. I hope sooner than later XXXX  will wake up and do the right thing and break the partnership with US Bank. Honestly I dont believe Ill continue shopping at XXXX  as long as theyre partnered with US Bank. Im moral individual and Im big on principal. With that being said my new purpose is to dedicate myself and exhaust all of my resources to expose companies like US bank and the XXXX US Bank Mastercard to EVERYONE!!!!!

"Dear CFPB, I am extremely dissatisfied on the lack of support, investigation, and safety by Wellsfargo Bank. I was defrauded out of {$2500.00} by an individual claiming to be a property manager and requiring a security deposit. I bought a Cashiers Check from Wells Fargo for the amount of {$2500.00} and deposited to the persons account. When I discovered that it was a bank fraud & their was never a property or managment, I immediately contacted Wellsfargo Bank both in person and via telephone to cancel the cashiers check. Wellsfargo notified me that the cashiers check was already deposited and they couldn't cancel it. To add insult to injury, they notified me that they wouldn't be able to refund my {$2500.00}.

I have been a Wells Fargo customer since 1997 and I am extremely dissappointed that they failed in providing a safe environment for their customer. I am prepared to take legal action against the bank for creating an easy platform for criminals to continue targeting victims with no hindrance. Wellsfargo and other banks have created a loose banking system that allows customers to get defrauded.

"I am an heir of my father 's property who died in XXXX. At the time a loan assumption paper was signed by me and my siblings ( 4 total ) to assume his first mortgage but the loan assumption was not signed by XXXX XXXX  to bind the contract. 

There are two other mortgages that was deferred until XXXX and XXXX that is good standing. At the time the first mortgage was assigned to XXXX XXXX. During that time we appointed my sister as the legal representative and she tried to assume the loan but did not pass the probation. 

However, during the process XXXX XXXX  sold it to XXXX only in my sister 's name and my deceased brother who was XXXX XXXX and could not XXXX  enough to understand what he was signing ( if he signed it ). Prior to the loan going to XXXX I had to go through a lot to get XXXX XXXX  to give me information about the loan but by the time they did it went to XXXX Because I was an heir and had assumed the loan so I thought. I do not believe that it was fair and I believe that XXXX and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing violated my rights to the information regarding my deceased father 's loan. And due to their negligence I was not able to get information about the loan until XXXX and learned that she had no paid rent since XXXX. 

My sister abandoned the property and I have moved in to save it from foreclosure which has a sale date XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  and Shellpoint Mortgage Servicing will not allow me the time to resolved this matter. Because I they withheld information from me since they first received the loan from XXXX in XXXX and did not discuss it with me until XXXX after reporting it to my credit ( which was disputed because they did not allow me to access any information about the loan ). I even tried to get them to send the information to my P.O. Box but they refused stating that they could only send it to one address ( there was four borrowers ) .I believe that they should allow me 4 years to resolve this matter and not 4 or 6 months because the arrears is now at least 48,000. Had the not refuse to give me information about the loan something could have been worked out before it got to that amount. 

Since sending in documents to FINALLY get access to the account they have added my name to the loan but honestly I do not believe the document that they are basing it on is legal and binding without XXXX XXXX  signature on it ( which means the loan should be still in my deceased father 's name ). 

Upon learning all that I have about the loan I petitioned the court to reopen my father 's estate to have my sisters name removed from legal representative. It was removed and I was appointed the legal representative in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I goal is to get our property that have been in the family since XXXX out of foreclosure and clean up my father 's estate which can not happen in 4 to 6 months. I was told by one of Shellpoint representatives that there was no point in giving an attorney my money to stop the foreclosure with a Chapter XXXX bankruptcy because it will not happen. 

Based on the incomplete documents the loan is still in my deceased father 's name and it was not only in my sister and brother 's name because nothing was officially assumed or modified. 

Due to the confusion that has been created my brother refuses to do a quit claim deed or loan assumption to protect his asset and my sister who was allowed to create such a mess as abandoned the property with no forward address or phone number. 

Given the present circumstance as my father 's personal representative I should be able to either reinstate his loan and have a payment plan for at least 4 to 5 years to pay the arrears without modifying the loan which would require the signatures. 

I have been advised to get from the courts and other agencies to get legal representation but the attorneys that I have spoken to all say that because of the date of the sale they are unable to take the case because of their workload.

"This is in regards to property located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Florida. 

I tried to apply for FHA Streamline Program recently. I was told about this program from XXXX back in middle of the year of XXXX. It was explained that knowing that the Co borrow was furlough, that we will not be able to apply for it until he's working again. At that point in time about the furlough it was clearly explained, all we had to do was prove that both of us is working now. That no other documents needed to be sent just 4 paychecks. 
That there was no appraisal, that they can remove the PMI. That there was no process time or anything else.. and that there would be no need for any type of credit check or anything else. Nor were they looking for any type of FICO score.they also have stated to me that they could remove the PMI if I do the steam line which could save me a few hundred dollars a month. Plus all for me a interest rate under 3 %. it seems at that point in time they was doing everything to try to sell the streamline refinance. They made everything sound good.even convincing us not to leave them to go somewhere else to deal with them and they'll be able to assist me better. They said had more to offer than anybody else and I wouldn't have to go through so much red tape. What was being offer before and what we was told back then, seems to be two different things that is going on now. 

However, when we went to go and apply for the steam line refinance. Everything that we was told was completely false information. In the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX. Two different reps with spoken to, and two different reps had two different stories to tell about the streamline. Yet we spoke into reps back in XXXX about how this program runs. It seems like every single rep was not on the same page with each other, seems like fasle advertisement and miscommunication. 

So now when my coborrower had returned back to work and we're ready to do the steamline refinance now we're giving a hard time. 

Now we're told we need it a certain XXXX score in order to qualify which that was never told to us before. 

Next we was told that we needed to supply all these different documentation just like if we was doing a regular refinance. Which at that point in time before we was told we did not need to supply any documentation but pay stubs only. 

Back then I was told I could remove the PMI since I've been with the loan for over a year already. which in this case they told me they would not remove the PMI if I do the streamline.I wanted to have the PMI definitely to be removed. 

Back then I was told I did not need appraisal. Now I'm being told they have to come out to the house and appraise the house to see what it's really worth.Which one I bought this house was a brand new house.. 

I was told before I could get an interest rate under 3 %. Then they telling me no that's not the way that program runs you can only go down by 1 % intrest so that means I would get a high 4 % .If that or maybe I might have to pay more an interest. Which that does not make any sense. 

I was told back then there was no credit check. And you didn't have to have the perfect credit score. Now I'm told that has to be a credit check and I have to have a excellent credit score, to qualify. 

We was also told before if I applied for the streamline, that I was told we could do a cash out. Because I wanted to consolidate my credit card debt into one. Then we was told that we could not do any form of cash out with this program. 

We was also told that if I do the streamline refinance, that there was no form of any type of closing cost or any other fees. Then I'm being told that there is a number of fees associated with it. 

So it seems everything that we was told about the streamline refinance, all has been lies. They also provided Fasle advertisement. I'm not the only one who feels this way on their XXXX and community boards, and social media, everything that I'm staying here basically is what a lot of people are also complaining about in their reviews.. 

I want this program. Because a lot of things change between my job and my co-borrower 's job. While we live in an uncertain world right now, we are trying to save as much as we can. So we can never fall behind. So now I want to do this streamline refinance.. however I want to do it with the promise that was given. Me and my husband and borrow XXXX, has been back and forward talking to PennyMac, and we all are being told different stories and it seems like some type of bait and switch is going on here with some false advertisement. Which they are misleading a lot of consumers. We would like that to change and they need to better train their reps and what information they are providing to the customers.",Mortgage

"To Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I am writing this letter to you today, XX/XX/XXXX to file a formal complaint about one of the three CBA 's - Credit Bureau Agency, specifically Transunion.

I have signed up with all 3 credit bureaus within the last several weeks to get updated status on my credit score and FICO score, due to my husband and I search for a purchase of a new home. Since the beginning of XXXX, XXXX ... I have contacted all debt collection companies on my credit report and have paid all debt completely off 100 %, and the collection agencies agreed to mark paid in full, and then remove off my credit report effective within 7-10 business days from our agreement which was on XX/XX/XXXX. After accomplishing cleaning up my debt by doing this along with a few other minor issues on my credit report, my score went up from the XXXX 's to XXXX 's. Now I get frequent alerts as to when something changes on my credit report, or alerts about my credit score changing, so as of XX/XX/XXXX all collections from XXXX accounts totaling {$1700.00}, XXXX XXXXl-3 accounts totaling {$450.00}, and Team Recovery ( which wasn't even in my name ) -2 accounts totaling {$1100.00}. However, recently in XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I received multiple alerts stating that under Transunion : "" the total balances on your collection accounts has increased '', reported from "" XXXX ''. So I went from reducing from 13 collections on my report from Beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, to ONLY having 2 Collections currently showing as of XX/XX/XXXX, and then to find out as of the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX, those same account that were deleted had reappeared but only on the Transunion Credit Bureau side, the other 2 bureaus had not received this information. I thought someone had committed fraud on my credit report or somethings so I contacted Transunion 5 different times, twice in on 2 different days and 1 every day thereafter to get an answer as to why this was happening, how did this occur, and why something that was already deleted off my report show back up again thru my "" XXXX  '' app and "" XXXX  XXXX  '' app as well, but only Bureau affected by the change or update was Transunion which I found very strange? After several complaints and disputes I have submitted with Transunion, the issue is still not fixed. Also I kept getting different Representatives tell me different scenarios as to why this could have happened, mainly stating it was the collection Agencies fault and they have put those accounts back on the report, but that could not be because it would have shown on all 3 bureaus again. I as also told by one rep at Transunion that if I cancel the dispute the report would go back to normal, mind you I actually disputed something totally different collection item most recently added to my report from XXXX for {$320.00} ( which was paid in full right around the same time it was reported to the credit Bureaus ), and Transunion put a dispute in for me on XX/XX/XXXX, said it should clear by XX/XX/XXXX. I was definitely okay with that one, but it somehow triggered the release of the old collection accounts that were deleted originally back on XX/XX/XXXX, and that was a problem! And now we are at XX/XX/XXXX and all 12 collections are still showin partial paid, half paid, or paid 100 %, but is still showing up ONLY on my Transunion report! I believe there a problem with their Transunion systems ( their online reporting and 3rd party reporting ) glitch of some sort, that is causing these old accounts to pop back up on my credit report after they have already been paid in full, declared removed, and deleted with deletion letters sent to the credit bureaus. I would like to get this handled for me, but also prevent this from happening to anyone else this has been a nightmare, stressful, and has caused me mental anguish, and is very unsettling to know that these errors and issues are happening to people and as consumers we can not do anything about it, but I refused to let that stop me and I will continue my fight for my rights and all of our rights!

"I have owned my home since XXXX but am danger of losing the home to foreclosure because the agents at DiTech will not allow me the opportunity to be considered for government programs for FHA loans. I refinanced into an FHA adjustable rate loan in XXXX through XXXX XXXX and this lowered my monthly payment. My loan has been transferred a couple of times and it is now held by DiTech. Last year I was XXXX and had significant medical bills that wiped out all of my reserves and put me in a tough situation. To make matters worse, my roommate lost her job and was not able to help out with her portion of the bills. I fell behind on the mortgage payment and reached out to DiTech to see if they had any programs to assist me. They told me they could offer a repayment plan, but when I received the paperwork I realized that this plan raised my payment over {$300.00} a month. This was not something I could afford.. When I inquired about modification, I was told that I needed to refinance my loan. This did not make any sense because I was already behind on my mortgage and I knew that was not allowed. I then attempted to get a review initiated for a modification but the DiTech agents stated that my rate is already low so I ca n't be considered for any other options and that now they were going to foreclose on my home. 

This is an FHA loan and I know that there are several programs available for struggling homeowners, such as modification, forbearance agreement or partial claim. I am certain that I fit the criteria for some or all of these programs and I am extremely upset that DiTech seems to think they make the rules instead of following federal guidelines. I was recently diagnosed with XXXX and was overwhelmed with significant medical bills that put me into an unfavorable financial position. In that same time frame my roommate lost her job and has not been able to pay her rent. These factors led me to fall behind.

I have a good job ( have been there 25 years ) and if given the chance I will make all payments as agreed. DiTech just has to understand the situation. I have even attempted to resume making mortgage payments but DiTech has refused to accept these payments, telling me the only option is to repay the entire amount due in one large sum. 

I am concerned that DiTech is not allowing me access to all government programs because they know the loan is insured by the government and they just want to cash in. I want the opportunity to fix it, and wish to file a formal complaint against DiTech in order to get them to play fair.",Mortgage

"This is an attempt to reopen complaint # XXXX My lease account from Nissan started in XX/XX/XXXX. My car was involved in an accident in XX/XX/XXXX. My insurance paid the remainder to NMAC in full, a payment of {$15000.00} was made to NMACE in XX/XX/XXXX. NMAC still shows that my account has 4 late payments adding up to more than {$1000.00}. This is not correct, the car is completely paid off. 
The company ( NMAC ) has failed to address any issue. In fact, when I submitted this claim I thought that I am just trying to fix a mistake that NMAC officers did. However, based on the currently available information, this is an organized embezzlement procedure conducted by NMAC to steal the customer 's money. NMAC is using the creditworthiness evaluation system to threaten me and to get more money than they deserve, or to correct their employee 's mistakes. 
NMAC 's response details a series of facts and communications between them and the insurance company. I was not informed of these communications. Here are the facts as I see them, these are my efforts to communicate with NMAC since the accident happened : 1-On the same day of the accident, I called the dealership and informed them that my car has been in accident and it is probably going to be a total loss. I was adviced by the dealership to call NMAC and arrange the payoff payment with my insurance. 
2-I called NMAC within the same week and inquired about the procedure that needs to be conducted. I was told that the insurance company will have to pay the "" payoff '' amount. No one mentioned the actual salvage value of the car. 
3-My insurance company XXXX reached out to NMAC and received a payoff quote of {$15000.00}, which is the same amount I received from NMAC 's online portal automatic quote. XXXX 's call with NMAC was recorded and sent to NMAC as a part of this investigation. 
3-By the end of XXXX, the car salvage value was evaluated at XXXX {$18000.00} XXXX higher than the "" payoff '' amount. XXXX sent a check to NMAC with the requested {$15000.00} and sent me the difference amount {$3200.00}. 
4- I was told by Metromile and NMAC that this was the end of the story and that my account will be settled once the NMAC receives the {$15000.00} check. 
5-By the first week of XXXX, I received a notification from XXXX  that my NMAC account is showing missing payments. I called NMAC and inquired about why is my account is still open. At the time, the {$15000.00} was received by NMAC. However, it was applied towards neither the monthly payments nor the car settlement. NMAC 's customer service told me that this is an error on their end and asked me to file a dispute with XXXX  to resolve it. No one mentioned that I still owe NMAC any amount. 
6-My dispute with XXXX  showed that {$15000.00} payment was made, but the missing payments were not removed. Therefore, I filed this complaint with CFBP. 
7-I reached out to NMAC in the first week of XXXX trying to understand what was going on. This was the first time I was told that NMAC wants me to pay the {$2000.00} amount. 
Here is what I believe happened. NMAC assumed that the salvage value of the car is going to be below the {$15000.00}. So they were OK with insurance paying them that amount. Once they recognized that the salvage value of the car was higher, they wanted to find a way to make this difference. However, they did not really contact me. They parked the {$15000.00} amount and did not even apply it to my monthly payments and kept passing missing payment marks to the credit bureaus. NMAC is now using the credit rating system to threaten and force me into paying the {$2000.00} amount, and they do not want to even remove the missing payment marks that they have wrongfully applied to my account. 

In short, I am getting all the damage from this relationship with NMAC. I have been very diligent in this process since day one. I have followed NMAC 's customer service instructions on every step, and I ended up with damaged credit. Even if NMAC should have received this money ( {$2000.00} ), that was not communicated with me at any stage during the 4 months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. In fact, I do not believe NMAC should get anything more than the {$15000.00} that they asked for. As I mentioned in the beginning, this is an embezzlement procedure conducted by NMAC. NMAC is using creditworthiness system to threaten and shamefully steal their customer 's money.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

On XX/XX/XXXX I transferred {$25000.00} USD from my XXXX checking account to my Coinbase.com account using XXXX 's website. My Coinbase Case # XXXX, the XXXX transaction # is XXXX, Federal Reference # is XXXX, and Reference # is IISTPBFP. ) The {$25000.00} was withdrawn from my XXXX account and the funds were supposed to deposited into my Coinbase account. However Coinbase has never credited my Coinbase account for this deposit. I have already contacted XXXX to confirm the money was sent out and delivered to Coinbase and there was no error on XXXX 's side. Please note that since this problem, I have thereafter successfully sent money from my XXXX checking to my Coinbase account without any problem using the exact same accounts and transfer method settings. This confirms that my transfer instructions was setup properly and that Coinbase is at fault. These missing funds have never returned to my XXXX account. Coinbase has my {$25000.00} funds and will not credit my account. Since XXXX reported there was no error on XXXX 's side, to try to resolve this quickly, I wrote to Coinbase Customer Support at XXXX and corresponded by email with "" XXXX '' and "" XXXX '' over 12 times since XX/XX/XXXX and provided them with the XXXX confirmation number and other evidence that the funds were properly wired from my XXXX checking account to my Coinbase account. Coinbase indicated that they are "" working with a specialist to address this problem '', but 11 weeks later, my missing funds have still never been never credited to my Coinbase account. Coinbase has been unwilling to deposit my own money into my Coinbase account.

ANALYSIS Coinbase 's response to my multiple emails is inadequate, unprofessional and has been extremely frustrating. During the past 11 weeks I have lost many investment opportunities. I file this CFPB complaint in an effort to finally resolve this issue and receive my own deposit of my own money as well as my legal expenses incurred to file this complaint. I am sure that the thousands of daily Coinbase users would rethink their use of Coinbase as their digital wallet to store and transact billions of dollars worth of funds if they knew that Coinbase could arbitrarily hold on to your deposited funds without depositing them into your account and fail to take steps to resolve the issue despite over 12 emails with confirmation numbers and other evidence clearly explaining the problem at hand.

CONCLUSION If this issue is not resolved shortly, I will further investigate my legal options and will consider reporting this matter to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, various US state regulators including New York Department of Financial Services concerning Coinbase 's  license both as a Money Transmitter License ( XXXX XXXX ) and Virtual Currency License, ( XXXX ), and may take additional US and international legal action for compensation of not only my missing funds, but for my ongoing legal fees and other damages. Please notify me immediately at XXXX when my {$25000.00} wire transfer has been properly credited to my Coinbase account.

"Venmo has refused to communicate with me regarding my being a victim of Fraud and also Identity Theft on their service. Because they say I'm not a customer ( I'm not ) they will not give me any information. I have filed a case with my Bank who has now closed the investigation with a finding of fraud. Venmo claims that's the end of it because in their POV, the Bank is standing and I do not. 

At their insistence, I have filed a police report. The report names me as the victim of Identity Theft. Resolving any claims with my bank is no longer an excuse to ignore me. 

Now their excuse is that "" I'm not a customer '' i.e. I haven't ever agreed to their terms and conditions, which undoubtedly states they won't communicate with anyone but law enforcement on such matters ( which is how they are now obfuscating the process ). Thankfully, I never agreed to their terms and therefore I'm not bound by them. 

I have repeatedly made Venmo aware of the facts, the bank investigation, and the police report regarding my identity theft, yet they refuse to talk to me or even return my communications. 

I'm now re-filing my complaint with the CFPB to now include Identity Theft, and more specifically, I'm naming Venmo as a party to that crime since they refuse to discuss the issue and provide any documentation on the crime.

Upon my walk through which did not take place until after my lease was signed, I noticed many things wrong with my apartment in the days/ weeks to come. In addition to but not including, there not being any running hot water in the master bathroom, many insects and small rodents, a noted coyote problem which was I was not advised of before moving in ( which is against the law ), wooden planks with nails sticking out ( violation of building and health laws ), due to all of the issues listed with some excluding, I eventually moved out. Before moving out, I did advise the rent office many times of the issues, the issue was escalated to the property manager and I was told that I would just need to provide them with a notice to vacate and that would be it. All women in that office are miserable, unprofessional, hateful, petty and honestly cause such shame to not only themselves but women in professional places in general. 

The cheap issues were fixed, the issues that cost money were not, and I served them with an intent to sue XX/XX/2020. After that notice was sent, the defamation of character slander began ( listed in the lawsuit as well ). The rent office, corporate and the property manager stopped answering calls and emails. Maintenance stopped fixing what they said they would fix in the beginning and served me with another statement that was over 4 times the amount of the first statement they sent.

That is nothing short of retaliation. They added on additional fees, out of pure spite and hatefulness. I asked for proof of the mess I left behind that resulted in the addition fees and I was told the company had no proof since it had been more than six months.

I asked why I received two different statements for two different amounts, one before being sued which is the accurate statement and the other which is false, after the lawsuit was served.

"In 2013 my students loans went into a repayment status, with an initial payment date of XXXX/XXXX/2013. I did not receive my repayment terms as they were sent to a temporary address and I was in the process of moving. I contacted the lender ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/2013 via their messaging system, as suggested in their emails, to inquire about placing my loans into a deferment status ( derogatory reporting had not begun ). The response from the lender was to complete an eligibility quiz on their website, and submit produced form, to which I obliged. In XXXX I retrieved the response, and submitted the form produced after completing the lenders eligibility quiz to the loan deferment department as directed, and assumed my loans were placed in deferment as indicated on the website. 
Two months later I noticed derogatory marks on my credit report and contacted the lender, at which time, due to their mistake, they agreed to backdate my forbearance and "" remove all delinquencies '' from my account. 
The lender has since refused to pass the updated account information along to the credit reporting agencies. I have disputed the delinquencies with the lender, credit reporting agencies, and the ombudsman on several occasions, however, the lender is refusing to update the account information stating because it was accurate "" at one time '', they do not have to remove the derogatory remarks from my account. In addition XXXX stated they were following Dept. of Education guidelines by keeping inaccurate information on my credit report. I have since confirmed with Dept of Education representatives, this is untrue. 
The lender 's failure to report complete and accurate account information is a violation of the FCRA section 623 ( a ). Furthermore on XXXX, I was advised the lender would not report any of my payments while the loan was in deferment status, and advised I put my loans into a repayment status if I wanted my payments to be reported, this is also a violation of the FCRA. 
At the advice of the lender I removed the loans from deferment, and they have since started reporting payments. 
I have since learned that not reporting payments to an account is a violation of the FCRA and requested to have my loans account changes removed. My loans have been placed back into a deferment status, however, they have not reversed any of the compounded interest. 
I filed a compliant with the Ombudsman and was advised on XXXX by representative XXXX XXXX that student loan lenders are required to follow the same regulations as other lenders and directed my to the Title XXXX, however, no where in the Title XXXX does it state that it negates other Federal Regulations, in fact there are several references to compliance with FCRA, therefore the lender is not above government guidelines and must report the retroactive deferment status, and removed delinquencies.

Part of the deal was my aftermarket studded winter tireIs would be removed from my the XXXX XXXX and placed on the XXXX XXXX. I had to get the sales manager involved to get the service department to execute this. I took the XXXX in roughly o n XX/XX/XXXX. I can verify this with phone records to get an exact date and time because XXXX XXXX service called mem and informed me they were going to have to give me a free set of new tires as my XXXX XXXX XXXX had already been sold by the dealership with my tires still on the vehicle. I had to approve the brand and change in the contract. I did and accepted the new tires in lieu of my personal aftermarket ones which had been sold with my vehicle. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, and continuously between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I kept in contact with GM Financial as they starting sending me late notices on the XXXX XXXX loan. I had contacted GM Financial immediately on the day of trade in to let them know I had traded in the vehicle, was cancelling the auto insurance policy effective immediately and refinancing the pay-off into a new loan with them, as there was a small amount of negative equity to be rolled into the new auto loan for the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The new loan reported initially ( and still is reporting ) for XX/XX/XXXX on the new XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX purchased at XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AK, on both my and XXXX 's credit report. I informed GM I was not going to issue a payment on a loan that had been rolled into another loan and closed out. Gm continued to insist the loan payoff had not been received from XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a credit change notice from my credit monitoring system with XXXX of a late payament greater than 30 days being reported by GM Financial for the original XXXX XXXX XXXX loan. I immediately called GM about the reporting. On XX/XX/XXXX I was told by GM Financial they had not received the payoff from XXXX XXXX and in fact I was accused by the customer service representative of not actually having traded in vehicle and was skipping on payments for a car still in my possession. I contacted XXXX XXXX, who provided me with the documents showing the loan initiated, pending and executed by XX/XX/XXXX. I was also given the trace number and proof of check made to GM Financial. GM Financial still refused to annotate or correct the reporting. During XX/XX/XXXX I had 2 open accounts with GM FInancial with one being reported late and open with a balance due in excess of $ XXXX. I also had a new loan showing open with GM Financial in XX/XX/XXXX with a balance in excess of $ XXXX. This loan showed up on my son, XXXX XXXX ', reports as well as a new loan in good standing. I have disputed this item directly with GM Financial many times. The legal assistance attorney from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, where I am authorized services as a military retiree, also wrote a demand letter of correction after reviewing all the documentation. I have filed a Better Business Bureau complaint. I even took the XXXX XXXX XXXX back to XXXX XXXX and turned it in as I felt they, and GM Financial were in breach of the original contract. I placed a stop payment on the $ XXXX down payment. When I returned the car and notified XXXX XXXX of the stop payment on the down payment the General Manager, XXXX, called me for his personal cell to my personal cell. He told me he would fix it. I spoke with the legal assistance attorney and was advised it was ok to pick up the car as it was mine regardless of the stopped payment. I arranged with XXXX to retrieve the XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX lot. My credit report was fixed to "" paid, never late '' but still open with a balance pending for about 9 dyas. Then it within 24 hours of my arranging to bring in a cashiers check for the down payment of $ XXXX, my personal credit report with GM Financial changed again to late for XX/XX/XXXX, late for XX/XX/XXXX and with a repossession on it. This was worse than when I started. I emailed the sales manager at XXXX and stated I was not going to reissue the down payment as the problem which they had originated as the dealership was not fixed and in fact was worse then when I originally asked them to fix it. In addition to all this, I received 2 calls from XXXX and GM Financial on XX/XX/XXXX. This was how I found out XXXX and GM were the same finance lender. I received these calls at work on my desk phone. I have the records. One verified my employment and the loan information with me. The second call was when I found out GM and XXXX were the same company and that the new loan had been approved as financed in full. This left me with the distinct impression the old loan was paid off by the new loan being executed and funded per the representative. I was even told I would see it on my credit report soon under GM Financial on these calls. I have records of all transactions, phone calls, sales receipts, emails, etc. I can provide upon request. I have already provided this to the XXXX, GM Financial, XXXX XXXX ( who provided me quite a bit of it originally ), and the credit bureaus repeatedly. I just submitted the disputes yesterday with the credit bureaus again. Only through repeated credit bureau disputes did GM Financial finally report the loan on the orignal XXXX XXXX as paid and closed as of XX/XX/XXXX. That is a physical impossibility if the new loan had to pay off the old loan and the new loan was executed in XX/XX/XXXX ; not ot mention my XXXX XXXX XXXX was sold by the dealership in XX/XX/XXXX and the check of final payment was cashed by GM Financial AND cleared through the dealerships bank account completely by XX/XX/XXXX. GM Financial hs denied the calls on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX even though I have provided them copies from my work phone records of both calls. THey have denied my phone calls to them even though I have phone records. Now XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX is contacting me for the $ XXXX down payment or they are threatening credit bureau reports and collection action. When I originally went into trade in the vehicle I informed XXXX XXXX that it was important no negative impact was on my credit report as I was initiating escrow to purchase a home. Because of the actions by GM Financial and XXXX XXXX my escrow application was ultimately denied due to the 43 poi9jnt drop in my credit score from the late report. The inaccurate debt-to-income ratio also has affected me negatively and prevented me from entering into a new escrow deal when compounded with the negative report that is completely inaccurate. I am already just recovered from a terribly devastating divorce. This was why I financed with XXXX XXXX and GM FInancial originally. I had no other options. But my good actions had resulted in a 9 % point decrease in the offered interest rate as well as placed the primary driver on the title and loan. The incompetence, refusal to correct and downright malfeasance and fraudulent behavior by GM Financial has had a tremendously detrimental effect on my life. It essentially lost me a house. Additionally, XXXX XXXX 's sitting on the payment ( according to GM FInancial ) for almost 2 weeks after they had already sold my XXXX XXXX ( with my personal property on it ) makes them both culpable and liable, as well as in breach of their contract with me for the $ XXXX down payment. I can provide copies of all documents via FAX, SCAN or hard copy upon request.

"I purchased two pieces of furniture from Raymour & Flanigan in 2019, at two different times, but both times using a promotional program that allowed me to pay over time and be charged no interest if I paid the balance in full before the due date. Every time a bill came I paid much more than the minimum due, with every intention to pay both items off on time and incur no interest. 

I discovered today that the item I purchased first did not get paid down in time and that I had incurred {$89.00} in interest charges. I called the bank ( TD bank, apparently ) to inquire and they told me that every payment above the minimum was applied evenly to the two items, and that if I had wanted the overage to be applied to the earlier purchased item I would have had to call them and ask them to do that. So notwithstanding that the principal balance on the first item was only {$46.00} and I had paid much more than than over the minimums on each bill my total bill for that item was now {$130.00}. 

I believe that I was the victim of a deceptive business practice, and that they have probably been doing this to a lot of people in order to maximize their fees. I had every right to expect that since I was receiving one bill and making one payment that they would be applying the excess payments to the first-maturing item. That they did not, and instead applied my payments so that they could charge me interest, is outrageous and fraudulent. They failed to clearly disclose that I would have to call them to have them apply my excess payments rationally. To me that's an omission of material fact necessary to make the statements they made about their promotional program not misleading.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"I participate in the Revised Pay As You Earn payment plan for my student loans serviced by FedLoan Servicing. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that I was required to re-certify my annual income and I filed a timely recertification using studentloans.gov the same day. Nearly 60 days later on XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that my re-certified payments were calculated at {$69.00} per month. I immediately realized that FedLoan Servicing incorrectly calculated my payment and I contacted Fedloan Servicing in writing by using the form on the Fedloan Servicing website on XX/XX/XXXX. I received no response from Fedloan Servicing based on my written complaint. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Fedloan Servicing to complain my payment had been incorrectly calculated. FedLoan servicing acknowledged that my payment was incorrectly calculated because a FedLoan Servicing employee erroneously processed my application with a family size of one rather than two, and ignored my husband 's student loans when calculating my payment. FedLoan Servicing acknowledged the correct payment amount was {$10.00} per month and agreed to correct the error. I followed up by phone three more times and on each occasion was told my payment would be reprocessed within 7-10 days. Today, XX/XX/XXXX I called again to inquire as to whether my payments had been correctly re-calculated.

I repeatedly requested I be billed the correct payment of {$10.00} for the month of XXXX as required by Federal Law and FedLoan Servicing refused.

"I had a loan with XXXX XXXX as I attended XXXX University. I have a total of 10 loans that remained deferred until XX/XX/XXXX. As I neared the end of deferment i looked for alternative way to defer as I was unable to make the minimum on the 10 loans that had been issued. I was denied any additional deferment. I remained in constant contact with the company and was very clear that I intended to stay in good standing with my account. I was offered a consolidation, I was assured that this would lower my payment and keep my account in good standing. 

I began the process and remained in constant contact in order to have understand where in the process I was and to ensure my account was in good standing. In XX/XX/XXXX I was instructed that I would need to make a payment in order to remain in good standing as the process had taken longer than anticipated. I did so believing that up until this point I had done everything in power to remain in good standing, as this is the information that i was being given. My Payment in XX/XX/XXXX was processed and the consolidation was processed in XX/XX/XXXX. I began to make the payment to the newly consolidated loan also to XXXX XXXX and have done so without delay and am current and in good standing. 

Fast forward to the present. I recently applied for a home loan and was informed that my credit score had dropped 130 points due to the reporting of each of my 10 loans being reported as 90 days past due. I was told that I was in good standing and doing everything that was asked of me. I was very deliberate in asking if my account was in good standing. My purpose was to avoid exactly what I am going through now. I was told in XX/XX/XXXX that I needed to make a payment which I did. I was never made aware that this was an issue. On the contrary I was made to believe that my account was in good standing and that I was doing everything necessary to keep it as such. Now I am being told that the burden falls on me because I can not prove that I was given incorrect information. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and was passed from department with no resolution in sight. The supervisor that I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX was rude and treated me as if I was bothering her and she had something better to be doing. I was told that the records do in fact show that I was in contact with XXXX XXXX throughout the entire consolidation process. It also shows the payment that I made in XX/XX/XXXX as I was instructed to do so to keep my account in good standing. I was told by a supervisor that they communicated the information via email and although there was no record of me being informed that my account was in jeopardy of becoming in a negative standing that the burden fell on me. Ultimately my credit score suffered and has made difficult to purchase a home. I should not be held responsible for the incorrect information I was given and have to burden the negative impact that this now has on credit score due to what has been reported to the credit bureaus. To clarify I am disputing all the loans that were furnished by the XXXX XXXX  were 90 days past due as of XX/XX/XXXX as I was given incorrect information throughout the consolidation process.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"On XXXX XXXX, I applied for a {$270.00} loan from Rapid Cash ( Speedy Cash ).

I debated this option and since I did not want to incur a return or overdraft charge with my bank, I changed the funding option to "" pick up at store '' but sent a message to the company telling them of my annoyance with the situation. 
Thoroughly annoyed at having to take this extra step to get the money I needed, I left the library at XXXX and ran up to the XXXX XXXX store to pick up my money. I explained the situation to the staff, gave them the confirmation number I had received from the website and then waited.

I just wanted the money and I wanted if before my bus came because I would have to wait another half-hour for the next one. I was also concerned about defraying the overdraft charge because the funds were not in my account when promised. 
I deposited the funds they gave me that night, XXXX XXXX, and kept in mind that they had told me there was a hold on a portion of the funds. I figured that when it cleared, I would be able to pay a portion of the existing loan.

One of the clerks said she would make a note of the confusion. I did n't get either of their names, they were not wearing them or they were not visible and I was in a hurry. 
I will pay back the money but I would like some leniency on the part of Rapid Cash because I had not intended to take that second {$200.00} loan.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I chatted with XXXX XXXX, who as soon as he connected to the chat and before I even told him what I was calling about, said he didn't have access to the cases. He wanted me to explain the whole thing again and give him account details over the chat, which is one of the first warnings of their own website ( never provide account details ). He claimed the funds were received on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX CDT, while one of the other representatives said it was XX/XX/XXXX, and the email said it was XX/XX/XXXX or sooner. 

The receiver does not have any deposits in her account in the amount of XXXX CLP on any of the dates the claim the funds were available. The receiver contacted her bank on XX/XX/XXXX and they said she had no transactions that appeared to be from MoneyGram nor any transactions that matched the amount to be deposited. 

All I have asked from MoneyGram is to confirm the exact date the transfer was made, the exact amount of it in XXXX  pesos, and the name, bank, and account number it was sent to, because the way I see it, if the date nor the amount match, the transfer was not made. I told them that if they had transferred a different amount, I needed to know so we could look for transactions matching that amount on the receiver side. They insisted the amount was correct, XXXX XXXX  pesos, so clearly something was wrong. 

My last attempt to contact the company was on XX/XX/XXXX, when I filed a second complaint with MoneyGram online, since I had been unsuccessful at getting any updates from the representatives via the company 's chat. I was given a case number ( XXXX ), and received an automated email response saying the company would contact me shortly regarding the case. Today is XX/XX/XXXX, and I still have not heard from anyone at MoneyGram. 

I have waited such a long time and wasted so much of my time waiting for a response, and still nothing. This company is not serious at all and I wouldn't be surprised if they either didn't send the money, they sent it to someone else, or maybe they sent a lower amount than the one agreed upon and that is why we have been unable to find the actual transaction/date. Unfortunately, they are not giving any confirmation of any kind and I am left with no other choice but to file a complaint. 

If they can not provide me with the information I am requesting, then I want them to refund me the money. This is just ridiculous.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

"Accounts added and/or created unbeknownst to me Notice to whom it be of concern, It is YOU I hold accountable and accuse of complicity in exercise of malevolent did-compliance. I hereby mark you as likely one that I might one day view in civil discord as the "" would be plaintiffs '', yet I declare to you your unjust claim is to be met with deliberate and determined resistance and counteraction. In is in clarity that your Claim of Non-Medical debt Collection is insufficient for collections much less reporting. You MUST DELETE this unjust injurious allegation because it is significantly deficient of the requisite certified reporting compliance ( such as perfect metro 2 format reporting ) and testimonial evidence of the PHYSICALLY VERIFIABLE PROOF OF VALIDATION as related to the full truth, accuracy, completeness, timeliness, ownership, identity of true debtor, dates, balances, audits, calculations, source codes, creditor collection code, 426-chrc P6 statement and its associated trailing fragments, the minimal five portioned personal identifiers, the pay statuses, the required 386-pieces of confirmation to collection, and elsewise standard or mandatory for proper reporting, mentioned or not. 



Although I am checking for and addressing missing and or deficient aspects of REPORTING COMPLIANCES and not contesting any debt of compliant nature, I should make you aware that since unlawful reporting transitions collection into an equally not complaint circumstance. Being still yet not validated by document fact in compliance to requisite standards, it is to be announced yet again that legally I have no knowledge of the validity of the alleged claims of delinquency and or derogatory nature, nor of the certifiably compliant matter to either any of its collection attempts and or its reporting despite previous consumer filed composed complaints checking for each. Might it be known, especially shall I elect to take this matter up to a civil court, any debt and or derogatory claim must be pursued ( particularly for collection ) in a very defined and precisely compliant and physically verifiable or certifiable manner as detailed in the requisite obeyed federal and state collection and reporting regulations associated with any of the above noted said claim ( s ) to include but not limited to the FCBA, FCRA, HIPAA PRIVACY RULE, FACTA, FDCPA and TCPA, etc. ADDITIONALLY, if an entity acts as a collector and also elects to act as a reporting party of consumer credit they must as well adhere to every single one even each any and all of the regulatory reporting requisites and standards of reporting with legal standing in full accordance of laws and accepted reporting standards. To date, the plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any capacity or willingness to validate the alleged debt much less certify the fair, accurate, complete and compliant reporting of the claims, particularly being significantly deficient is any display of certified metro 2 compliance. As such, given the fact of recent breaches of information collection repositories, I am hesitating to readily accept what is presented without testimonial and certified physically verifiable document evidence of claim as being legitimate. I deny nothing, yet I reserve the right to question any unproven claim. I do NOT accept the statement of claim of the plaintiff and I call for the court to reject their claim as untrue, unverified, incomplete, not compliant or otherwise invalid and thereby reject-able and dischargeable which requirement to be dismissed in full. I demand said court resolution today, even here and now in full accords of regulatory statutes, mentioned by me or not. 


1 ) To date, I have received no knowledge of ever entering into any contractual relationship with the to-be plaintiff ( s ) { should I forward into a civil complaint } or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued against me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or accusations similar. This despite repeated calls to the accusers to demonstrate the requisite presented physically verifiable document proof of adequately acquired permissible purpose from the exactly and only individual irrefutably identified as being me. I have no acknowledgement of a relationship with the parties mentioned, in any form.

2 ) I have no knowledge of ever knowingly acknowledging ( or even unknowingly doing so ) that I owe any proven and compliantly reported debt, much less the claim of unproven debt alleged in this written declaration CHECKING for not only VALIDITY of CLAIMS but also DOCUMENT PROOF IN CERTIFIABLE TESTIMONY as to the factual and complete COMPLIANCE to all standards and laws, even the mandatory Metro 2 Format Compliance. Its obvious that the allegations filed by the accusers ( or to-be plaintiff ) are in clear subterfuge of act, be it in willful disregard of ethical practices or be it done so in ignorance of requisite ethical and regulatory compliant behavior during their accusations, collection efforts and credit reporting of claims. The vile nature of their derelict is unjustly injurious and unlawful no doubt. I again call for a dismissal of to-be plaintiffs statement of claim ( s ) and discharge of misreported delinquencies and derogatory behavior that the accusers complaint is undeniably unfairly lodged versus me. 


3 ) I have no knowledge of ever receiving any proven or document facts in statement of account or account aspects for these items of alleged debt and delinquent actions. Again, I reiterate I have called on the accusers to present to be document certifiably true, correct, complete, and adequately compliant documentation in full validation of claims, rights to collect alleged claims, and rights to report alleged claims. Let it be true that COMPLIANCE of regulatory requisites is MANDATORY not OPTIONAL. Plaintiffs claims are mute of legal standing in full accordance of law and must be dismissed.

4 ) I have no knowledge of ever entering into an open account with to-be Plaintiff ( s ) or with the entity ( ies ) that allegedly issued me the defaulted line of credit ( s ) or derogatory claims of credit.

5 ) FACT IS, no claim above has even submitted adequate compliant proof of the genesis of any consumer/creditor relationship and their inability to prove application, permissible purpose for said alleged application, consumer/creditor agreement in contract describing a relationship related to alleged claim of account and or debt ( s ), and or otherwise derelict documentation of claim ( s ) inherently makes invalid the to-be Plaintiffs whole statement of claim in this summons or complaint. I request court to resolve adequately and compliantly as required with the immediate eradication of complaint charge ( s ) and rectification of any injurious collection or reporting practices. Again, COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE COLLECTION PRACTICES and equally COMPLIANCE of APPROPRIATE and COMPLETE REPORTING PRACTICES is MANDATORY, NOT OPTIONAL. 


6 ) As it stands, until PROVEN OTHERWISE, the complaining to-be Plaintiff ( s ) does so unjustly, unethically, and likely illegally so in absolute deficiency of requisite legal standing in full accordance of applicable laws ( mentioned or not ), both to collection practices and as well with reporting practices, particularly in the inability or unwillingness to timely and  fully certify physically verifiable document proof in full validity of debt claim or compliance of reporting, even to the mandatory Metro 2 format. As such, here again I declare my right and preference to stand against all claims of the to-be Plaintiff ( s ) and call on your authority and INTEGRITY to ensure truth of claim, correctness of claim, completeness of claim, ownership and responsibility of any debt ( s ) or delinquencies of debt alleged in above noted claim ( s ), perfect and prove-able compliance of collection actions related to claim ( s ), and compliance of reporting actions related to claim ( s ) ... ... ... ... ... ... ..","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

He then in a very disrespectful manner told me that he was going to note the account as me stating I said involuntarily and then hung up on me. I called be and calmly told him I 'm aware that most of the calls a water recorded and that if he chose to note something directly against what I said I would do, that was slander, and illegal.

I was told that the card had not been used yet & they closed the acct. In XXXX XXXX I received a Macy 's bill for {$1300.00}. I called Macy 's again & was told that the card had been charged on XXXX but a processing delay meant that the rep had n't seen it when I called.

I submitted my Identity Fraud Affidavit, Police report, proof that I was at work XXXX miles away that day, & proof of identity. I waited a month & called Macy 's to check on my status ... they claimed that they never received my proof, that is until I showed that I sent it via certified mail. I was told that they 'd "" expedite '' my claim ... I called in XXXX XXXX ; nothing had been done. Macy 's reported the account as delinquent & my credit was suffering. They told me that I could do nothing about that but promised to "" expedite '' my claim ( again ) ... nothing happened. I called in XXXX, same thing.

I was put on hold three times, each for about 45 minutes before the line was disconnected. 

My rights as an identity theft victim have been violated by Macy 's reporting the account as delinquent while it is under investigation.

During the application, i found out that in spite of my excellent credit score, over 750 on both XXXX and XXXX, i was given a credit balance of only {$5500.00}. This was not even enough to cover the purchase. I accepted it because 1 ) my credit was already hard pulled at this point and 2 ) there was the balance transfer offer i could use.

Now that I've submitted the balance transfer, I notice a charge for {$130.00} as a transaction fee! I then called customer service and they informed me that this is an expected fee. 

I feel this is a bait and switch and that i was lied to. This was not disclosed in the initial offering link that i followed. 

I would not have applied for this card if i had known there would be a fee. 0 % APR on balance transfers for 20 months does not mean that they get to charge me a percentage on any other fees that they decide to name something else.

"Dear XXXX XXXX : Thank you for the reply to matter # XXXX. Please let me clarify and respond. 
1. My requests to you for your personalized response, left on your direct voicemail ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) where all attempts to grant you permission to call and discuss the matter with me. Hiding behind a request by me not to receive automated collection calls is absurd. You officially, on the record, have my permission to call me to discuss this matter. 
2. Beginning in XXXX XXXX, by my frequent and regular communications with Discover I have expressed nothing by an interest in working out these obligations so that I can better pay them on a regular basis while also begin repaying my federally secured student loans. Asking for a principal reduction was only one request. If you were to spend some time listening to previous calls and reading account notes, had your team members properly documented the account, you would also hear my many requests to restructure the loans to lower the monthly payment. That can be done by graduating payments, amortizing over a longer period of time, forbearing one loan while the other is being repaid, reducing the interest rate, and on and on. The number of possible work out solutions is quite expansive. Instead, your company with their consistent and robotic responses have said there is nothing we can do. 
3. Contradictorily, your representatives have also told me each time I called since XXXX that I could pay a lesser amount, representing one month 's payment per loan to avoid the loans charging off at 150 days. I was also told, on numerous occasions now, that the loans would be turned over to the insurer after the loans have charged off at the expiration of 150 days past due. 
Since XXXX, I have been following that edict, alternating payments of approximately {$230.00} per loan around the XXXX and the XXXX of each month. The significance to those dates is that when I called in XXXX, I was told by the representative that Loan XXXX was at that time 141 days past due and that it would hit 150 days past due on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. On the same call, I was told that loan XXXX was 110 days past due and that it would hit the 150 days past due mark on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have not missed a payment since making the first payment on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Surprisingly, when I called this week on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to make a payment ( the first business day after XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ), I was told both loans were 139 days past due and that they would hit the 150 day mark on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This is highly questionable given my payment history since XXXX and at the least, unfair and deceptive treatment given prior conversations with your company 's representatives. 
4. What has become even more alarming now, is that in your response to my CFPB inquiry and complaint is your position that you "" will be [ filling ] a claim with XXXX soon '' and that my only recourse at this stage is to bring the accounts current. Not only is this statement abusive in that it now threatens something that is contrary to what I have consistently been told since XXXX, it is unfair and deceptive. This bait and switch approach to collections is the very reason the CFPB exists, to help level the field and open communications between company and consumers. If I could afford to bring my accounts current on the schedule you now prescribe, I would not be talking to you, your collection representatives, or the CFPB.

"Dear Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. Below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18U.S.C. 1621.

The tradelines listed below are items currently within my credit file, and none of these are related to any transaction that was made by me. It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

"After leaving the hospital, a number of bills were sent to me. I sent many of them back to charge my insurance. In this case, XXXX never responded to me about my insurance. They finally sent me a single bill, which I began paying without realizing they still had n't answered. After setting up bank payments, I never got another statement, never received a balance, nor have I been able to reach anyone. After sending several payments and receiving no statement or method to determine what was paid by insurance, still owed, or had been received, I sent them a note indicating I needed a statement from them, at least. Nothing. Then, I pulled my credit in XXXX and saw that the debt had been referred to a collection agency. This agency has made zero effort to contact me, had none of my previous payments associated with the accounts so the balance reflected the full amount, and has not responded to complaints with the credit reporting agency other than they consider the debt valid. I believe that they need to at least TRY to contact me so I can pay this. It 's such a stupid amount that if I had gotten even one additional statement or notice from them, I could easily have paid. And I STILL do n't know if they even tried to bill my insurance like all the other bills that were submitted. I paid every single much larger amount to all other medical agencies because they did bill insurance and then followed up with a statement. It may be that there is an amount that is due, but I do n't know what amount and ca n't get an answer. I also feel like it is fraud to just try to ruin credit for someone without even trying to let them know. If XXXX had sent me a bill, this would have been paid easily.

"I closed the above Credit Card accounts with US Bank a few years ago.

I am aware of {$3.00} in one account alone in which they mailed me a check then stopped payment on it causing me 5x the amount in bank fees by my new and current bank that the check was deposited into. I believe this was done intentionally and maliciously in retaliation for my filing a complaint against them in the past.

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX from US Bank followed by a check in the amount of 13 cents re : interest and/or fee adjustments on dispute or fraud claims I filed against them with the past 8 yrs.

Does the CFPB know that in, almost the second quarter of the 21st century, the only way to contact this XX/XX/XXXXdefectives is BY TELEPHONE! NO EMAIL, NO FAX, NO NOTHING BUT PHONE!! My XX/XX/XXXX has forbidden me to speak with call centers because it is deleterious to my health. Heres proof!

Phoning gets the customer to cubicles of bogus CSRs in 3rd-world countries, e.g., XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. where NO ONE ( and I mean NO ONE ) speaks or understands any form of English that I was taught as my first language from birth. And when I scream repeatedly, "" I DON '' T UNDERSTAND A WORD YOU ARE SAYING!! I WANT SOMEONE WHO SPEAKS INTELLIGIBLE ENGLISH!!! "", the answer is ALWAYS : "" I speak English! '' Well, how shall I put this? Go XX/XX/XXXXyourself, you useless XX/XX/XXXX! If I can not understand you, then you do NOT SPEAK ENGLISH. This is what the shysters in the C suites of this prolapse bank think is how to treat customers. In the past 3 months, I have closed a credit card account ( with a $ XXXX credit line ) and now a ludicrous checking account with a balance of ... XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX US dollars XXXX 

And it took me XXXXXX/XX/XXXX calls XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXXto finally reach another XX/XX/XXXX in the USA. The first 3rd world XXXX with XXXX leakage ( an alleged manager who is only qualified to lick my XX/XX/XXXX) told me there was no such account with the account number I gave him. Really,XX/XX/XXXX How come the fist-bottom XX/XX/XXXXin the US could find it with no trouble? Why? Because you are a genetically defective mutant whose entire race escaped XXXX and should be extinct. But rather than extinction, these citz bank XX/XX/XXXXPAY YOU A SALARY because they believe that, not only will you SOLVE PROBLEMS, but also engender customer retention. Chew on my XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX! 

The lyingXX/XX/XXXX in the US whom I interacted with on XX/XX/20 my 16th XX/XX/XXXX phone call told me he had closed my account ( he may have had a human name, but who gives a XX/XX/XXXX what it was? ), gave me a confirmation number [ XXXX ] that he no doubt fabricated out of his XXXX, and told me I would receive the {$6.00} balance in my account by check mailed to the address on file that he confirmed. Lying XX/XX/XXXX. 

Never have received anything. Never will. I would relinquish my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX if this company and every XXXX who is employed by it would implode.

"This is a problem with XXXX XXXX XXXX and Capital One. I have a XXXX XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX which is managed by Capital One. 

I believe Capital One had a system upgrade during the spring time, and there could have been some problem, because I have not received any statement from XXXX XXXX XXXX   from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, so automatically my balance became "" unpaid '' without noticing at all. 

I have not received any statement or any notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX credit card in XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX until I received an email from XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX "" We see you missed a payment on XX/XX/XXXX '', which was a big surprise to me, since I have not received any statement/bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX for a few months. I looked back my email account and really there was no statement emailed to be in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXXuntil I received such alert email. In a shock I immediately went to my account and I saw late fees and interest. XX/XX/XXXX was Saturday and the coming Monday was a holiday so I waited until Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX,  and contacted customer service of XXXX XXXX XXXX. I told the situation that I had never received any statement email or any alert email when I missed my payment due dates in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX until I received one in a few days before. They waived the late fees but did not waive the interest, which was over {$80.00}. To manage, I immediately paid the balance. I can not understand why I have to be responsible and have to pay the interest, particularly with my 100 % on time payment history with full balance until then. 

Please investigate the issue with Capital One and XXXX XXXX XXXX. Not only the unfair interest was charged to me, but also this incident damaged my credit score. You can see my past very high credit score and payment history if you investigate.

"I purchased a tv from Best Buy in XX/XX/XXXX. I was pressured to open a credit card to charge the purchase.

I was completely unaware the interest charged would be this high suddenly. I have called Citibank to try and resolve this issue with absolutely no solution offered. I have never been able to catch up from this substantial interest charge and still owe a balance on the account. My statement end balance for XX/XX/XXXX is {$810.00}. I have maintained minimum balance due of on average XXXX XXXX/month towards my balance for 19 months roughly equalling {$570.00} paid towards an initial {$150.00} balance due.

This is the main reason the CFPB receives XXXX complaints on Experian a year and Experian has not changed the way or process they verify consumer data because they DO NOT CARE about insuring, they post accurate and verified data on a consumers credit profile. At the beginning of XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed Experian had reinserted items back on my credit report that had previously been removed. Experian did not send me ANY notification nor did the entity that Experian claims verified the erroneous information on my credit report PRIOR to reinserting these negative inaccurate unverified items on my report which are listed here as I have asked by phone and mailed letters to Experian disputing there claims and to remove and delete these negative inaccurate unverified items OFF my credit report.

On XX/XX/XXXX this homeowner found out she was being pursued by XXXX XXXX XXXX. to collect a debt for the City of XXXX regarding delinquent trash taxes from XXXX. Upon inquiring on the day with the City 's tax office ( XXXX ), this writer found that the taxes for XXXX had not been paid as well.

XXXX insisted that the tax bill was this writer 's responsibility which was opposite to the resolve met with XXXX ( sup ) of XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, she was not supportive in revealing the internal supervisory or managerial structure so this writer could bump the issue up to a higher level. As a matter of fact, XXXX left this writer on hold until she finally decided to simply hang up. 

After that, this writer called XXXXXXXX XXXX Point of Contact office and spoke to XXXX. She suggested this writer write to Executive Complaints, and/or call Dovemuhle back and ask for their tax department. This writer called back to Dovenmuhle and spoke to XXXX who stated this writer could not speak to the tax office because it is offline, so this writer asked for a manager. Instead, a supervisor by the name of XXXX answered. This writer asked for a manager but she was informed management staff was not available. XXXX reviewed this writer 's case and concerns, and informed management would be made aware, review the situation, and get back to this writer in two hours or by tomorrow. This writer informed XXXX of how ridiculous it was for XXXX and XXXX to not be supportive regarding this tax bill considering that XXXX is in the first lien position, and the government trumps them if not paid. 

P.s. 
This writer inquired on XX/XX/XXXX as to whether this call and the call on XX/XX/XXXX were recorded. She was informed by XXXX that all calls are recorded.

"My XXXX XXXX loan with TIAA serviced by XXXX is coming out of forbearance XX/XX/XXXX due to hardships due to COVID. We had been promised by TIAA that an option for us at end of foreclosure would be to resume our same monthly payments prior to the foreclosure and defer the missed payments to the end of the mortgage, putting them into a payment due at the sale, refinancing, or end of the loan. However, XXXX is saying that is not an option for us. The only reason they are giving is that XXXX told them it is not an option. "" XXXX '' a supervisor at XXXX, told me deferring payments to the end of the loan is not an option and my only 3 options are : foreclosure ; pay all payments back in a lump sum ; or loan modification where the interest gets capitalized into the principal of the loan and we go an a three month trial period. When I asked him to put these options in writing, he said he can't and wanted to know which one of three I wanted to do. I had no choice but to agree to the modification because he said TIAA is prohibiting us from deferring the payments to the end of the loan. He gave no other explanation. The loan modification option penalizes us because now we will have to pay much more for our home if the interest goes into the principal. Furthermore, XXXX has been stringing me along for six weeks, telling me our file was in underwriting with my request to defer payments to the end of the loan when in reality, nothing was happening with my loan. up until yesterday, Knowing our forbearance period was ending XX/XX/XXXX, I telephoned XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to "" XXXX ''. I told her when my forbearance ended, I wanted the missed payments to go to the end of the loan. After asking me a series of questions, shesaid this was an option for me and she is sending it to underwriting for review. She told me to wait 30 days for a decision and to be on the lookout for documents in case underwriting needed more information from me. She said we were not required to make a payment until the deferment information comes. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called because XXXX sent an email to me saying I needed to contact them immediately. "" XXXX '' with XXXX said to ignore the email, it is automatically generated and she could see my file was in underwriting. XX/XX/XXXX, I responded to a snail mail letter from XXXX saying to contact them. "" XXXX '' said it was a form letter and to ignore it. XXXXconfirmed that my file had my request to defer payments to the end of the loan but that it was still in underwriting but since it has been 30 days, she transferred me to "" loss mitigation. '' After a 2 hour hold time, I talked to "" XXXX '' in loss mitigation who said my loan shows it is still in forbearance because customer service transferred it out of underwriting but had no idea why. She said TIAA loans are a little different from the other ones they service. She asked me the same series of questions I was asked on XX/XX/XXXX, and said she would "" escalate '' the file. She said not to make my XXXX payment until I hear about the deferment of payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I got a telephone message telling me to call XXXX immediately. I called back and spoke to "" XXXX '' who said it was a "" general outreach call '' and I could ignore those. She said my file had only been in underwriting 26 days and saw that it had been "" escalated ''. She said it is weird that it is taking so long and didn't now why my file now said "" modification '' and not the request for deferring payments to the end. She said to ignore calls, emails and letters unless they are asking for specific information from now on. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from XXXX naming "" XXXX XXXX '' as my mortgage resolution advocate. I called the number for him which was just the same XXXX number. "" XXXX '' said she could not transfer me to XXXX because the letter I got was a "" template '' but she could help me. She said that my file had two open requests, one for a modification and one for a deferral of payments and they were due to be resolved today and to try back at the end of the business day. I told her I never requested a modification and I have always been asking to defer the payments to the end of the loan every email I sent and every call I made to XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX I asked for this. She said I should talk to a supervisor and I was transferred to a general voicemail box. I phoned back and after 50 minutes on hold talked to "" XXXX '' who said XXXX was her boss. She said she is emailing her supervisor to talk to me about my file because it is "" stuck '' in forbearance and hasn't moved since I asked to defer the missed payments back in XXXX. She said she does not know why my file "" hasn't moved '' but that TIAA had a "" role in it. '' She said a supervisor would talk to me that night. "" XXXX '' from XXXXtelephoned me that evening and said I was not permitted to have the option of deferring my missed payments to the end of the loan. I asked him why, during all the calls and people I talked to since XX/XX/XXXX when I was told I could request that opton, no one ever told me I was not allowed that option. He said "" I don't know, I wasn't there. '' Without any explanation, XXXX said TIAA would not allow us to defer our missed payments to the end of the loan. We feel we have been deceived and defrauded by TIAA since TIAA has always maintained that deferring the missed forbearance payments to the end of the loan was an option. We don't know why XXXX is now saying TIAA won't allow us to defer our missed payments to the end of the loan because they refuse to provide an explanation.. We first elected forbearance on XX/XX/XXXX when TIAA serviced the loan ( not XXXX  ) with XXXX XXXX of TIAA who told us that if we go into forbearance due to COVID hardship, we would not suffer having to pay any additional money, any fees, any penalties or any reporting to the credit bureau agencies. XXXX for TIAA has violated all of that ( see previous complaint about how they reported us to all 3 credit bureaus as delinquent while we were in forbearance! ). If we do the modification XXXX with XXXX is offering ( and the other 2 options are forclose or pay missed payments in full ), it will put our interest into the principal and so we will then owe more money on the loan. TIAA promised us we would not suffer having to pay more money if we went into forbearance but now XXXX says TIAA will not allow us to defer our payments to the end of the loan without any other explanation. TIAA has always maintained that deferment of missed forbearance payments was an option for us. For example, a XX/XX/XXXX letter from TIAA states "" mortgage deferments '' may be available. In a XX/XX/XXXX letter from TIAA, it stated options available include "" a deferment. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, "" XXXX '' with TIAA specifically stated we can elect a "" deferment '' where past due payments are a "" payoff at the end of the loan maturity date. '' She also stated when we are ready to resume making payments we can avoid paying the "" big chunk all at once '' by having the "" payments tacked on at the end '' of the loan. She said, to get the deferment, we have to be able to make mortgage payments going forward and have recovered from the hardship and only the past due payments are tacked on at the end. However, now "" XXXX '' at XXXX is saying TIAA will not make that an option for us without any explanation. Please help us get TIAA and XXXX to do what TIAA said we could do : Defer our missed forbearance payments until the end of the loan. Prior to going into forbearance, we were never late with any of our mortgage payments and currently our credit bureau scores are in the 800 's "" excellent '' range. There can be no good reason why we are being denied the opportunity to defer our forbearance payments. Thank you.",Mortgage

"I XXXX XXXX, was contacted on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated she was an employee of Aldridge Pite Haan and she would now be handling the case. XXXX XXXX verified the aph file number, address, last four of my SSN, told me the call was being recorded and then proceeded to inform me that the purpose of her call was to see if I would be willing to settle the order for a fair amount. I advised XXXX XXXX that I would not be agreeing to settle as this is a collection on a fraud account. I begin to ask XXXX XXXX about the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit that was returned to her office and received on XX/XX/XXXX as stated in my previous complaint. XXXX XXXX informed me that the investigation was closed as I did not include a police report with the document when it was returned. I informed XXXX XXXX that I could not obtain a police report and that when I went to the XXXX Police Department I was informed that this case was too old to file a report. I instructed XXXX XXXX to pages 5 & 6 of the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit document and the fact that the document do not only require it to be returned with a police report, but that it could be signed and returned in the presence of a law enforcement officer, a notary, or witness. The form does not state that a police report is required for investigation or if a police report is not included the investigation would not take place and nor was I ever told that by XXXX XXXX. He advised me that an investigation was ongoing and to give it some time. I then asked XXXX XXXX is that the only reason this case was not investigated and XXXX XXXX informed me that she could not tell me that information, but she could only tell me that it did not include a police report therefore the investigation was closed. I  advised her that I have a copy of the identity theft victims complaint and affidavit form and I would be contacting XXXX Police Department to speak with the Chief about filing a report. 
I asked XXXX XXXX about getting information to put on the police report as I only had Aldridge Pite Haan information and I only have XXXX XXXX XXXX name, but no address or contact phone number for them. I informed her that would not be enough or valid information for the police report. I need an address as to where the credit card was sent to or the city or anything that I could use to obtain a police report. XXXX XXXX told me that she could not tell me what to put on the police report. I then asked XXXX XXXX if I should contact XXXX and she told me not to contact XXXX as they no longer was handling this case. I asked if I should contact XXXX XXXX XXXX and she told me not to contact XXXX as her company Aldridge Pite Haan is representing XXXX and I would need to go through them for information about the case. I again asked her if she would provide me with the address as to where the credit card was sent according to XXXX XXXX XXXX as I needed that information to give the police a lead as to where the fraudulent activity took place and she informed me that she could not give me that information. I then asked about contacting the lawyer XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX that is showing up on the court document filed with XXXX County Court and she told me not to contact them either as they were no longer handling this case. I informed her that she was making it impossible for me to obtain a police report as I have no information to give to the police other than Aldride Pite Haan address and contact number. 
XXXX XXXX then proceeded to tell me that she does not know why I keep saying I wasnt served when I filed a response with the court. I informed her that I received a letter in XXXX and upon receiving that letter I immediately went to the XXXX County Court to file a response to that company. XXXX XXXX went on to advise me that the purpose of her call was to make afair offer to settle the case. I asked her what did she consider a fair offer and she gave the amount of {$1400.00}. I told her again no and that I would not be settling as this is a fraud case. She then asked what I would consider a fair settlement and I told her {$100.00} if that. I explained to her that this ordeal has made it impossible for me to pay my mortgage or keep up with my bills and told her the amount that had been collected out of my paycheck up to that date. I inquired about what would happen with my funds if I could get a police report turned in and where was my money at this point. XXXX XXXX told me that she could not guarantee, but if after the police report was received and it was determined to be fraud I could possibly receive my money back even possibly if I agreed to settle and it was determined fraud I could ask for my money back. XXXX XXXX informed me that Aldridge Pite Haan had not received any money as of XX/XX/XXXX and that because of the pandemic happening it could be a while before anything was received by her office. She gave me an update on the balance due as of XX/XX/XXXX of {$1700.00}. 
I informed XXXX XXXX before we got off the phone that I would be reaching out to the Chief of Police at the XXXX Police Department. 
After our call ended I immediately called the XXXX County Superior Court and spoke with XXXX. XXXX reviewed the case as I had several questions about my response. XXXX advised me that I responded to an answer on a contract. That response was due within 30 days of receipt and I made my response on time. XXXX explained that I was not served and that the answer on a contract request did not include a court date as one had not been set at that time. XXXX advised me that after my response in XXXX the XXXX County Superior Court did not receive anything else from XXXX XXXX XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted a document showing that they submitted a Plaintiff Request for Admission of Facts to an address on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX County Superior Court received a request from XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting a Motion of Summary Judgement. XXXX then informed me of the address listed on the paperwork XXXX XXXX XXXX showed they sent the Plaintiff Request for Admission of Facts and it was to an address that I did not live at during that time. I informed XXXX that I had already been to that apartment complex and got the management company to verify and give me a letter stating that I did not live at that address during the time XXXX XXXX XXXX mailed/submitted those documents. XXXX then went on to explain that me not living at that address and not ever receiving those documents was a problem because I had no way of knowing any court dates set or that I needed to file a response to any documents XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted. I advised her that I needed an address for XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX or something to show an address where the credit card was sent and if it was included in any of the paperwork at the court. XXXX advised me that there was nothing submitted by XXXX XXXX XXXX showing any information relating to XXXX or any information about the credit card, address or paperwork that I could use to file a police report, nothing other than the Motion for Summary Judgement and whatever was included within that judgement. 
After speaking with XXXX XXXX called the XXXX Police Department and inquired about what information I would need to file a police report regarding identity theft. I was instructed to call Aldridge Pite Haan and again ask if they would provide me with an address as to where the credit card was sent. I called Aldridge Pite Haan on XX/XX/XXXX @ XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX and she verified the aph file number then transferred me to XXXX XXXX to speak with XXXX XXXX as she is handling this case.

Finally in about XXXX that day I got a girl on the phone she just hate I'll tell you exactly what happened to the girl you spoke with yesterday you said you were proved you were she kicked it off to that supervisor on the floor problem was he didn't have the authority to add that to the account so he pushed it up too I guess the Lead Supervisor that would have been on the day before XX/XX/2021 so it got forwarded to a lead on the floor he or she could not do it then it went to a supervisor in the supervisor had to kick it up to main management well main management signed off on it send it straight back down. Nobody got around to putting it into the computer and adding the funds into my account will at XXXX she told me that evening the system the computer system automatically kicked it over to a investigator which she says when that happens they can't add it. I said I don't understand she can host I have a note from XXXX XXXX something this morning that the supervisor tried to add it and could not because the system kicked it over to a dispute investigator I said well how is that and anyway my issue. You all have verbally guarantee that you were issuing this to my account I never even asked you to. It got sent through your your lead on the floor to your supervisor all the way to main management and every one of them approved it and send it back down and because of a software issue not because of any legal thing not because I'm not entitled to not because I was denied it can't be added. She goes that's what I'm telling you it says in here. That's what has happened. I was so beside myself the man in the morning. Morning at XXXX XXXX shook me up so bad he told me I was denied and would not say that I was ever told I was receiving it and lie to me I can not believe what this company has done they would not allow me on the phone with the supervisor. The supervisor in the morning could not add it and override the system although by all means I was approved all the way through main management of the company. That's a lot of approvals. And it's like somebody screwed up and totally like stonewalled me at that point was afraid they were going to be in some kind of problem. And would not allow me to speak to a supervisor anyting. They transferred me around for four and a half hours that day and would never put me on the phone with anybody of any sort of management supervisor or so forth I could not get past the regular customer service employees. I don't know what they did in that account but they literally would not let it go any higher I am under the distinct impression that somebody screwed up really badly and they weren't going to let it be now. At about XXXX that day after all the hours on the phone I get transferred around in circles to three different formats consoling the last man I spoke to goes well I can tell you already there's a letter going out to you today that your dispute this is not are you joking what are you talkin about my dispute was approved yesterday with through countless verifications and I didn't ask for this. It was approved all the way to management back down and then today I'm told that none of that happened and another question I asked him I said would you please inform me what the merchants have said I have every right he goes we're still waiting on any kind of response I said of course you all your investigator didn't get this till XXXX last night. Today is XX/XX/2021 is still never received a letter saying my dispute for tonight I should have had the provisional credit this past Monday at the latest actually should have been last Friday when I was supposed to have everything give it back to me in my account. I can not believe the way I have been treated I mean to go through all of this knowing that I did not authorize these charges and for it to be approved through all of them steps up to upper management and back down and then to call in the morning and be lied to completely I mean in completely and find out in the afternoon that it was because of a software issue with in their system and then be told I was denied and investigator had no chance to even get a response from Merchants he only had it since the night before and I don't believe he was working then. I was told the supervisor tonight at night yet there's no supervisors working tonight that's what the gentleman told me when I called at XXXX the customer service agent that gave me all the information said the same thing. This company has done something very very very very very bad and I am beside myself. They have lied to me not giving me my money I have never received any paperwork from them and they will not allow me to go any farther than when I call your denied that's all they say they won't give me any information to back it up nothing.

"I have a XXXX 's credit card, which I used to make a purchase in XX/XX/2020. Typically I pay my card ahead of time, but with the pandemic and lots going on with my family 's health, I innocently forgot to make a payment. No one from XXXX 's or XXXX reached out to me. I didn't even know the card was issued by XXXX until I logged into my XXXX 's account online, realized I had missed 4 months of missed payments and called into their contact center XX/XX/2020. XXXX says I didn't receive a reminder for my payment or any notifications for a past due amount because XXXX still had my old information - which I was unaware of, and wondered why on earth they didn't have my updated information because : Before the pandemic, I had moved and updated all my contact information ( address + phone number ) associated with my XXXXXX/XX/XXXX account - or so I thought. No one told me that I needed to go one step further and update the info with XXXX. I thought I had taken all the responsible steps necessary. The credit card holder agreement does not spell out that the customer is required to take additional steps to reach out to XXXX and update their information. 

Therefore, all paper statements and outreach went to an old address, and calls went to an old phone number. XXXX claims they sent me statements electrionically, which they did, however, 1 ) the email statement comes from a XXXXXX/XX/XXXX address which went to a spam folder, and 2 ) this is not notification of a late payment - it is merely sending the statement electronically. If XXXX was reaching out using my old contact information with no success, they should have contacted XXXX 'XX/XX/XXXX to see if they had the right info. Furthermore, instead of syncing the information which I responsibly updated in my online account, they have told me that it is my fault that I didn't take the extra step to update XXXX. I wasn't even aware of XXXX - given the site is completely branded XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. 

I find this misleading and an unfair burden to the consumer because the card is 100 % branded XXXXXX/XX/XXXX and there is no mention of XXXX on the actual card, service phone number, etc. I was thoroughly confused by their lack of ability to sync customer contact information - and if that is not spelled out in the card holder agreement, how am I supposed to supernaturally know that I need to take the extra step of coordinating with XXXX, whose brand is not visible to me in any way through the management of my XXXX 's account.

This possible RESPA violation occurred with XXXX XXXX ( sales associate ) and XXXX XXXX ( lender ) at the William Lyons XXXX location. 

The background context is that XXXX did not have the knowledge to structure and approve this buyer for the purchase. We were using an outside broker and specialty program in order to do this loan. XXXX called me pretending he actually worked for the sales office and his company did not have confidence we could close the loan and I needed to explain to him the program and how we structured. After about a minute I realized this guy was a scam and actually the lender looking to copy our program/structure, but he had already obtained the information he needed to go back to the buyer and offer the same program. Frustrating, but I understand not everyone in this business operates with ethics. 

The attachment shows how XXXX was violating RESPA in an attempt to force the buyer to close with William Lyon mortgage even after he let her know we were his lender of choice. It wasnt until after I mentioned XXXX and CFPB that she changed her tone and was willing to cooperate with the items we needed from her to do our job.

I tried to short sell my condo twice. the last attempt failed because Green Tree demanded I bring additional money to closing to pay them and sign a paper that basically said I would still pay them the total loan amount. The XXXX loan bank got angry and said Green Tree 's terms were not legal so the short sell fell through twice. 
While all this was going on, Green Tree illegally obtained phone numbers for All my previous employers and for a handful of my family members. Green Tree called them every day, all day long from XXXX to very XXXX. They told people they were looking for me because I owed them money. They told them to tell me I had better pay them. Green Tree also asked everyone if they thought it was right that I was n't paying them. 
The phone calls greatly affected my life. I would receive phone calls from family members and previous employers telling me I had better get my stuff figured out so Green Tree will stop calling them. I almost lost my job because the phone calls at my work would n't stop. I made several calls to Green Tree asking them to stop but they never did. I had to file chapter XXXX and get a lawyer. Even with the right paperwork filed, Green Tree did n't stop. 

It is now several years later and Green Tree has been pulling my credit about every 4 months. I sent them a letter asking them to stop and they sent a letter back saying they had a right to pull my credit if they wanted to. 
Green Tree has put me through XXXX and made a huge spectacle of my financial situation. Just because I owe someone money does not give them the right to be abusive, curse at me, inform anyone that ever knew me, they feel I 'm a dead beat who owes them money and threaten me.",Mortgage

"On XX/XX/2016 we bought XXXX XXXX XXXX to purify our household water and our drinking water. With the notion, that the system will take out all impurities out of our water. After 3-4 months from the date of installation we started noticing a yellow, orange, red, and greenish color substance in our showers, toilets, and sinks. So we called the sales person over 50 times and he did not answer. Finally, we got in touch with the main office and the manager called us back. He came to the house, we showed him the problems. He took samples, and they were inconclusive. Then we called again, spoke to another manager, he came out same thing. Then they sent a tech out, the tech informed me that the reading should be under 10 because it is a new water system, when he did the test, there was no difference between the city water coming into the house and the water coming out of the system, which I saw with my own two eyes because he was showing me the reading. After he saw the readings he tried to change his story so we called the main office and spoke to the main guy in California. After a heated debate we left off on that he was going to figure out an alternative option something like switching out the machine for another one and we hung up.

So I stopped drinking the water and cut off the payment that was being directly withdrawn from my bank account for almost two years. Ironically, my health got better yet my level of stress with this company got higher. Thats when they started calling us. We explained the situation they told us they would get back to us within 48 hours and nobody called us back. They sold our account to a collector who demanded payment. We explained to them the situation they said they would call us in 24-72 hours and no one called us back. A few months ago they called us again. We explained to them the situation again this time they even confirmed the notes on the account & said they never received one single payment. Which is a lie because we have bank statements to prove it. We even told them to come get their machine and they said that it would be a good idea to come get it and yet again NOTHING was done.

He insisted the dealership should have told me the car would be classified as "" repossessed.

For constructive fraud because they were careless and negligent in misrepresenting, concealing, and making false statements regarding the status of my surrender of the leased vehicle. They "" lost '' the vehicle, then "" found '' it and subsequently classified my return as a repossession is an attempt to cover up their own mismanagement of the return.

"On the date XX/XX/2021, I requested that Equifax remove several accounts. On the date of XX/XX/2021, I received a response from Equifax which is Nine days past their time to respond. I've made it clear that Equifax was committing multiple violations according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Pursuant to 15 USC 602 ( a ) ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy. Notice How Congress did not define "" Privacy '' under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Therefore, my rights to privacy have been compromised as I am a private consumer, I never gave consent for Equifax to furnish anything. I have you know that No Consent is considered identity theft. This is Equifax first violation, let 's move on ...

According to 15 USC 603 ( 2 ) the term consumer report does not include ( B ) any authorization or approval of a specific extension of credit directly or indirectly by the issuer of a credit card or similar device. The definition of a credit card pursuant to 15 USC 1681 is the same pursuant to 15 usc 1602 ( I ). The term Credit Card means any card, plate, coupon book, or other credit device existing for the purpose of obtaining money, property, labor, or service on credit. Congress said ANY card. The Credit card I am referring to is my social security card, which is the credit card I used to originate the consumer credit transaction. This is Equifax Second Violation.

Furthermore, Pursuant to 15 USC 604 ( a ) any consumer reporting agency may furnish a consumer report under the following circumstances and no other : ( 2 ) In accordance with the written instructions of the consumer to whom it relates. Notice how it says written Interactions of the "" consumer '' I never allowed or given my consent to Equifax to furnish anything about me. I make it known, according to 15 USC 616 Civil liability for willful noncompliance ( a ) Any person ( The term person means any individual, partnership, corporation, trust, estate, cooperative, association, government or governmental subdivision or agency, or other entity. ) who willfully fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this title with respect to any consumer is liable to that consumer in an amount equal to the sum of ( 1 ) ( A ) any actual damages sustained by the consumer as a result of the failure or damages of not less than {$100.00} and not more than {$1000.00} ;","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"I am writing regarding a serious matter wherein Carvana has violated FDIC Fair Lending laws by engaging in a pattern or practice of differential treatment of prospective loan applicants on the basis of race or ethnicity. 

I initiated a loan online, and provided all the requested documents - my pay stubs and Drivers License. I waited for the documents to be verified. The next day, Sunday, I called Carvana and spoke with a representative who said that my paystubs were not sufficient. Keep in mind, I was told this only after they had already received my drivers license and could clearly see Im a minority woman of XXXX. Seems that if paystubs are not sufficient for proof of income, Carvana wouldnt make it an option to begin with. Anyhow, I was then told by the representative they would now need to verify my employment by calling my employer. I am employed by my husbands XXXX and we have been in XXXX in the state of Florida for over the 13 years ( our XXXX XXXX can be easily verified via the Florida Dept of State -XXXX XXXX XXXX   website ). I provided the representative with the business name, phone number, and my husbands name. I was told they would call to verify my employment. After waiting a day with no calls to verify employment, I decided to call Carvana again to find out the status. This time, I was connected with a representative by the name XXXX. Let me start off by saying I was floored by my experience with XXXX - he was extremely insulting and demeaning. When I first get on the phone with him, I ask about the status of the verification as I was told it was going to happen the prior day. Well, now according to XXXX, the verification of employment was no longer sufficient either and was no longer an option for me. Now, I was told I had to provide 3 months of cancelled checks. Why were my paystubs not enough to begin with. Why was I told in the first place that they would call to verify my employment to substantiate my proof of income only to later be denied that option. According to XXXX they need to verify the XXXX   phone number attached to the XXXX  ( as he stated ). Well I explained to him the circumstances of how my husband owns the business, and suggested he take the time to research Florida state records he would see the XXXX XXXX  in my husbands name and I even offered to submit those documents for o him along with a phone bill from XXXX showing my husbands name and phone number on the bill. That wasnt sufficient enough for him. When I questioned the loan process and asked if they treat all loan applicants with this amount of scrutiny as I felt the differential treatment was racially based he said boldly youre coming to Carvana requesting a line of credit and we dont have to approve you for anything. I immediately asked to speak to a supervisor as a I was offended and appalled that a company such as Carvana would allow their representatives to speak to potential customers in such a demeaning way. He did try to diffuse the situation but the damage had been done. At that point is was clear to me that Carvana was engaging in discriminatory lending by making more difficult for me obtain a loan. I eventually requested that he have his superior contact me. I received a call from XXXX, who also was very unhelpful and condescending in her responses to me. I asked her why was I being required to go through all these lengths to prove employment and income. I mentioned to her that a colleague of mine ( a XXXX is woman ) got a loan with Carvana and was able to submit simply her pay stubs and that was sufficient, why is it not sufficient for me? So first the pay stubs were not enough, then the phone verification was not going to be sufficient, now I am required to provide 3 months of cancelled checks? Verifying my employment is simple yet Carvana representatives refused to do so. It is obvious that Carvana has engaged in discriminatory lending against me by using different standards in determining whether to extend credit. It was not until after Carvana received my license and identified me as being XXXX XXXX XXXX, that I was required to provide additional documents that are otherwise not required to be provided by other non minority applicants. 

This is a serious violation of civil rights and Undoubtedly if this has been done to me, it most certainly has been done to other XXXX XXXX  XXXX  as well. During these challenging social times, it is unacceptable for a company such as Carvana to  practice these unethical discriminatory lending tactics.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"I submitted an application for an income driven repayment plan to XXXX in late XXXX. I did not check a box that asked me if I needed a forbearance on my payment while the application was being processes because my payment at that time was {$0.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notice that I owed {$1100.00}. I called customer service on XX/XX/XXXX and explained what happened. I was told that I could request a forbearance over the phone. We agreed on a payment of {$500.00}. I was told that I would receive a bill in XXXX reflecting the new amount due. 

In XXXX, my account still requested that I owed {$1100.00}. I called back on XX/XX/2019. I was told that whoever I spoke with forgot to submit the request, and that "" it would get taken care of right away. '' I asked how this would affect the status of my application for income-driven plan. I was told it would delay the process until XXXX but that as soon as I made the {$500.00} payment, it would move the process forward ( because I needed to make at least one payment on the standard plan- or on agreed upon forbearance in lieu of the full payment, i.e. the {$500.00} ), and that a new billing statement would come out show that I did not owe the remaining {$670.00}. I paid the {$500.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. My account reflected that I paid the {$500.00} but still said I owed {$670.00}. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. This time I was told that 'somehow my account wasn't reflecting ' that I only needed to pay the $ XXXX that whoever needed to process it didn't process it correctly, but that a notation would be added to my file, and my account updated. As a result of the delay, my application for an income driven plan was delayed until at least XXXX. 

I waited, and nothing happened. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. This time I was given brand new information. Specifically, I was specifically advised that what I needed was an 'administrative forbearance. ' I asked why this was the first time I was learning about this. I was told that 'unfortunately, not everyone understands all of the rules, and you probably got bad information. ' I expressed my frustration with receiving such conflicting information. The person I spoke with was kind, but ultimately, unhelpful because nothing happened. My account still reflected that I owed {$670.00}, and stated that I was delinquent in paying it. 

I called again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with someone named XXXX, 4 or so days after my account reflected that I was delinquent in paying the {$670.00}. I asked what was going on ; expressed concern that my account showed that I was delinquent for a payment I had been told several times I did not need to pay as a result of requesting the forbearance. She advised that she would put in a request to have my account reviewed to accurately reflect what I had been told. I was told this would take 10-15 business days, and to watch my 'portal inbox ' for a message. I was assured that my credit would not suffer because they don't report delinquencies to credit agencies until much later down the line. I waited for the message- I didn't receive one. 

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with someone named XXXX, ID number XXXX. I asked what was going on- explained the number of times I had called, the conflicting information I received, and the fact that my account was now more than 10 days delinquent. She looked into my account and confirmed that there was a request that it be reviewed. She advised that they were behind, and that things were taking longer than usual. She assured me that I had done everything I could, and advised that the only thing left to do was wait. 

On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, my account still reflected that I was 14 days delinquent for the {$670.00} payment, and that I owed another {$1100.00}, due by XX/XX/XXXX. I finally just paid the {$670.00}, as I have zero confidence that failing to pay it won't have an impact on my credit. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, my account reflects that I owe {$500.00}, due by XX/XX/XXXX. I am confused by this update, not the least because I have not once received written notice ( in my online portal or otherwise ) as to what is going on. {$500.00} IS the amount I agreed to pay as forbearance for the initial {$1100.00}. I paid this on XX/XX/XXXX. Why am I being billed {$500.00} again? I suspect it is because I was not credited for the {$500.00} that I paid- that somehow I'm starting from scratch with this new {$500.00} payment. 

I feel strung along, and abused. I signed up for the Income Driven Payment plan because I have limited income. It is important to me that each of my payments count towards 'qualifying ' payments. Not, it has been over 3 months since I submitted my application. I have paid {$1100.00} ... to start the process??? My account reflects that I owe another {$500.00}. Why? I have no answers. And it seems that I every time I call, I get different, conflicting information depending on who answers the phone. 

I am making active steps to pay off my loan. I WANT to be on a regular payment plan so I can pay it off. This company is making this nearly impossible. When it finally does take action, it fails to communicate what it is doing. I am left with unexplained bills, an application in limbo, and nearly {$2000.00} I will have paid that won't count towards qualifying payments. Meanwhile, and perhaps the most egregious, my interest continues to mount as they sit on my application. This is disgusting.",Student loan

On XX/XX/XXXX my boyfriend sent me {$500.00} to my cash app XX/XX/XXXXXXXX. I no longer have access to the phone number associated with my cash app. I had to create a new cash app account XX/XX/XXXXXXXX to even contact support. I tried to get access my old account via email with cash app support. I verified everything they asked me to verify and was still told that for security reasons my request to access my old account was denied and that the decision is final. I repeatedly asked cash app support what steps I need to take to recieve the money that was sent to my account and to have my ticket escalated to a supervisor. They kept stating there is no additional information and that they would close my support ticket. My boyfriend ( the sender ) also put in multiple support tickets trying to get refunded for the {$500.00} since they would not give me access to my account. He was told that I would have to contact support on this issue and that there is nothing he can do on his end. I read under cash apps terms & conditions that when a peer-to-peer ( P2P ) transaction is initiated cash app can hold the funds until the payment is accepted or refused but not more than 14 days and that after 14 days by law they must return the payment to the sender. So we waited 14 days and then my boyfriend put another support ticket in to see why the funds were not returned to him.

"In XX/XX/2020, I entered into an agreement with my apartment management, XXXX, to defer partial rent. I requested to be let out of my lease early multiple times ( 60 days early, 45 days early ) any time that would save me money and avoid being in debt. They continuously refused but set up a seperate payment plan for me to pay over the course of the summer. 

My lease ended on XX/XX/XXXX. Within 1 week of vacating my unit on XX/XX/XXXX, I was turned into IQ Data International, Inc for collections of debt owed in the amount of {$4600.00}. Not only was this a violation of our agreement, but this amount was incorrect. The amount owed was {$2800.00}. I contacted IQ Data and the property management immediately to discuss the charges and get them corrected. 

For almost month, I emailed the property management with little to no response. Finally the property manager acknowledged the mistake and sent a new ledger to IQ Data. This ledger continued to be incorrect. Having to fight for the right amount to be reported to the collections agency basically blew through any grace period that I had. According to IQ Data, I had a 45 day grace period which ended on XX/XX/XXXX, which means that they turned my balance into collections the day after I vacated the property. No final bill was sent my forwarding address. No attempt by management was made to collect debt. It was literally turned into collections the day after my lease ended. I attempted to get the correct amount updated upon receiving my first collections letter. 

I emailed and called both parties to correct the amount. I copied the property manager, the regional manager, the Vice President and the dispute team. None of which replied. On the last day of my grace period, I had to physically show up at my former property manager 's  office and make her correct the mistake as she would not acknowledge any of my electronic communication.

I am not experiencing any curtailment of income to cause a discrepancy of this sort. ( MISSING PAYMENT ). Please review to reconsider the details of this matter. 

On XX/XX/XXXX during a phone call wirth Westlake Financial, I authorized payment via customer solutions inbound by providing my card information. However, my bank never received a request for that payment. After speaking with a Westlake representative a second time they verified on XX/XX/XXXX. I noticed the balance in my account had not decreased. The rep informed me of the current status of my delinquent payment. Although they verified I previously spoke with them, they had no explanation as to why the payment was never processed. I reauthorized and reprocessed the payment. To never deal with this confusion again. Automatic payments are set in place to assure future on time payments.. If the payment was processed by Westlake during that phone call, the payment would have been 6 days late, not 10. As per your contract it states if the first payment is late, there would be a 10 day grace period for submission along with a late fee. 

Please consider carefully reviewing and exhausting all efforts to rectify this account. As this seems to not be the best car buying experience. I trust that your team is dedicated to servicing your clients. Looking forward to a formal follow up.

"I am a citizen and resident of XXXX, but between XX/XX/XXXXand XXXX I was employed by XXXX XXXX XXXX and lived in California. Through my employer, I had a XXXX managed through XXXX. When in XXXX I was about to move to XXXX, I wanted to consolidate my accounts in one institution, and I chose Bank of America ( BofA ), which is where my checking and credit-card accounts were. ( If I remember correctly, I spoke about this to XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX at BofA, at the BofA branch on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA ). I was very clear about my residency and citizenship status. Nonetheless, it was suggested that I rollover the XXXX to an IRA with Bank of America, and so I did, sometime in the spring or summer of XXXX. 

At some point later, BofA had XXXX XXXX manage the account. I was informed of this, but I had no say in the matter. 

Then last week, I received a letter from XXXX XXXX stating that they will no longer be the custodian of the account, and that it will be liquidated 30 days after XX/XX/XXXX. On the phone, they explained that this is since I am not a US resident, a fact that was known to them when BofA had me open the account 11 years earlier, and throughout those 11 years. Making some more calls, it turns out that no financial institution is willing to be the custodian of the account, since apparently they I am not a US resident. Thus it seems that BofA behaved either with negligence or fraudulently when they had me open an account in a way that may not have been legal. 

Thus, my retirement account will be closed without my consent, and I will be forced to be responsible for the tax, early withdrawl penalty, and any other costs. 

( I should say that I kept two addresses with BofA : my address in XXXX, and the address of a friend in California who was helping to collect my mail. You can see both addresses in the attached screenshot from the BofA web page. Over the years BofA sent me many account reports to the address in XXXX, so they knew all along that that was where I was living. )","Bank account or service, Savings account"

"Hello, I was browsing an app that someone told me to check out and then put it down, a hour later i got an email saying my loan was approved and My cash was being sent out, but I NEVER MADE A LOAN.

I called the agency, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and asked about the garnishment.

The following day ( XX/XX/2021 ) around XXXX EST as I was checking my emails looking for the confirmation from the travel agency ( which hasnt arrived ) I only saw an email from Discover which arrived at XXXX EST informing me that a purchase attempt was flagged as suspicious and had been declined requiring my personal confirmation. To me this meant that the transaction was not successful and the tickets were never ordered as I did not provide any additional authorization per Discovers email communication. However at XXXX XXXX I received another email from Discover stating the following : Thanks for confirming your recent purchase. Upon seeing this email, at XXXX XXXX, I immediately called Discover card services, explained the circumstances and was reassured by the Discover customer service representative that the transaction at the time of the call had still not gone through. At this time I asked that any further attempts of processing the order were blocked and that the transaction was canceled completely. I was reassured by the Discover representative that the transaction was indeed cancelled noting that there was nothing to worry about and there were no further action required on my end. 
After the live communication with Discover representative I continued to search for other tickets as we were going to a family reunion and we needed to secure our flight. I proceeded to order online thru a website recommended by my son XXXX 
Later that day ( XXXX ), as I was checking my emails and to my surprise I received a ticket confirmation from XXXX at XXXX EST. Additionally, at XXXX EST, there was another email from XXXX notifying that the credit card used had been declined for the booking and the transaction needed further action in order to be completed. 
Given the assurance in the morning by the Discover representative and the final email communication from XXXX notifying me that the transaction was declined, I was led to believe that no charges had gone through. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received the statement from Discover, with a charge from XXXX included. I proceeded to call Discover card services to dispute the charge and explained what has occurred a week prior. I was once again reassured by multiple tiers of Discover customer service representatives that the charge would be marked as disputed and removed from the statement. It was recommended that I also attempt to call the vendor ( XXXX ) directly to see if there was anything they would be able to offer but despite my trying, the vendor blocked my attempts by being unresponsive, asking me to call back numerous times and essentially giving me the run-around. 
On XX/XX/2021 I received an email confirmation from Discover card services that the circumstances were investigated and that they had ruled in my favor.

Over the last several months, I have called and talked to Discover representatives over ten times to try and resolve the dispute but despite several promises to reopen the case and rectify, little to no action has been taken on Discovers part. Several representatives have apologized to me about the mistake and made promises that it would be resolved and that I would receive a phone calls from Discover supervisors within 48 hours. Despite the promises, with weeks and months passing by, I was left to call back yet again and again. The lack of professionalism and due diligence from Discovers side is unacceptable ( as was acknowledged by Discover representatives on several calls held ) and should not be how long-time customers and consumers at large should be treated. 
As is likely evident, this situation has caused me emotional pain and suffering been much more stressful than what anyone should endure when a mistake was made by a credit card company ( allowing a transaction to go through after being asked to cancel and assuring that direction would be followed ). I am seeking resolution to this situation and would like to be refunded the amount I was charged, as Discover has promised over several months.

"I contacted banks directly to review negative items listed on my credit report. Corrections and payments were made directly with the banks but, the items still appeared on my Experian account well after they were removed from the other two credit bureau accounts. I disputed with Experian but, the results were that "" no changes '' could be made and I was not permitted to dispute again because they were already disputed. 

The rating seems arbitrary and decreases without reason. Following the guidelines as stipulated by the credit bureaus individually, I reduced usage to below 1 %, removed all credit delinquencies, make all payments on time, cleared ALL debts, and the last missed payment was over 3 years ago. The more I abide by the stated rules, the lower my credit score trends ... almost daily and without any changes to the items on my credit report. Experian has yet to provide an explanation for this downward trend. 

Following the rules has diminished my credit rating. But, lucky me! If I sign up for another credit card through Experian 's referral service, I just might improve my credit rating.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

How is it possible that this was verified if you continue to report incomplete, inconsistent, inaccurate, and unverifiable information on this account and a thorough and in-dept investigation. Ive disputed and I havent received anything as such, but it continues to be reported in violation of the consumer laws.

Continues to report wrong balance, incorrect date of first delinquency, wrong date of last active, inconsistent payment status, high balance and actual balance is questionable, etc. I believe that section 609 of FCRA also allows me to ask for detail information about the account and how you indeed investigated and your detail process. Im extremely upset and shocked about the way this charge-off account is reporting on my credit report which continues to report with incomplete, inconsistent and unverifiable Info.

"I have a loan with Sallie Mae that i signed with a cosigner to help me pay for college. I have never adjusted the original terms of the loan since I took it out, even though I make only {$20000.00} a year. I called to ask for lower monthly payments from the current {$340.00} a month that I pay. This amount is nearly 20 % of my monthly income and does not even include my XXXX other student loan payments. The other XXXX I have allowed me to be put on an income based repayment plan, but not Sallie Mae. ( Not to mention my Sallie Mae loan has an interest rate 3 % -4 % higher than any of my other loans ) I have been a good borrower in the 5 years since I left college yet they refuse to work with me. The only option they offer is deferment. Putting the loan on hold for 3 months while still collecting interest is not going to be a long term solution for me. Yes, they would love it if I kept putting my loan on deferment I 'm sure because it means more money in their pocket. They do n't care it does absolutely nothing to help the borrower. 

The lender is supposed to be serving the borrower, not the other way around. My experiences with this company have been nothing but awful. I would recommend anyone who needs a loan, student or otherwise, to get it anywhere else but Sallie Mae. I have never dealt with such a horrible company in my life. I call ahead of time to let them know I ca n't make the payment and they tell me that the collections department wont even speak to me until I let my loan payment go late. Once it goes late however, they have no problem harassing me 7 times a day. Then I call them back only to wait on hold for an hour and to be told that no changes will be made to my loan. 

I am now left in a position where I can continue to pay the loans and have nothing left over to try and improve my life ( like finishing the few classes I have left on my degree, or moving into my own apartment ) or I can destroy my credit while improving my situation, because the XXXX loan i have that takes up 20 % of my income refuses to help a proven good borrower.

"During late XXXX and early XXXX 2015, I initiated XXXX different new auto loans with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

I have been making payments on this loan and the current balance is much less. 
Meanwhile, the XXXX of the XXXX loans in the amount of {$34.00} continues to linger on my credit report and is reflected as "" open ''. This amount is added together with the XXXX loan, which is valid, and added to the total amount I owe at the beginning of my credit report. 
I have contacted XXXX XXXX several times about this. Each time I am informed to wait another month for the matter to be resolved. I first reported this problem in XXXX so I have now waited 3 months. 
This is not only incorrect, but I am hampered from obtaining additional credit, because my total of monthly payments on XXXX open auto loans exceeds my income to monthly payment ratio.

"In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted my annual documentation to re-apply for income-based repayments. I had previously done so and been on a {$0.00} per month since payments began on the loans in XX/XX/XXXX. I  submitted my XX/XX/XXXX tax return via Nelnet 's online portal which redirected to the IRS 's website for confirmation. Once I completed these steps I was under the assumption that no further action was required. Since I had made around the yearly income as I had made the previous year, the monthly payment was to remain at {$0.00}. I did not hear anything from Nelnet after submitting my tax return. Around XXXX  or XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text message from Nelnet saying my loans were about default and immediate action was needed. There was an option in this text message for me to apply "" yes '' to start forbearance. I immediately signed into the Nelet website and saw I was 6 months behind on payments. No income-based payment plan had been applied to my account and I had been responsible for the full monthly payments since XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately replied "" yes '' to the text message from Nelnet and called Nelnet to find out what was going on. When I reached a representative, it was explained to me that they did not receive my documents to reapply for the income-based payment plan and thus I had been on a regular payment plan since XXXX of that year. When I asked why Nelnet had not contacted me prior to 6 months of late payments the representative was unable to say for sure. I would like to reiterate that I received no letters or phone calls from Nelnet about this matter until the text message that was sent after the accounts were 6 months in arrears. Since statements were set up to be received online, I never received a statement in the mail about this matter either. Had I known they did not receive my documentation, I would have gladly re-submitted so this matter would have been resolved in a timely fashion. While speaking with the representative, I immediately submitted my tax return again and after a couple days of processing, my payment was changed to {$0.00} per month, as I had already thought was the case. If NelNet had alerted me earlier that they did not receive my documentation, or alerted me after the first or second missed due date, this matter could have been resolved months earlier without the detrimental effect on my nerves, well being, and credit history. I have repeatedly tried to reason with Nelnet on this but they refuse to admit to any wrongdoing on their behalf. It has been years now of disputing this with them. There has not been a single issue or missed payment or missed deadlines on my account other than this incident, yet Nelnet refuses to concede any mistake. I can't say for sure how the mistake happened. It could have been a technical glitch when I uploaded my tax return, a human error that deleted it after it was uploaded, or any number of reasons. All I can say is that I did my part and uploaded the document in a timely fashion well before the deadline. I would have been happy to upload it again as many times as needed had I known there was an issue. It was not my fault Nelnet didn't properly process the request. As seen in my attached document, Nelnet continues to treat this issue as a regular missed payment event with a request for forbearance after the fact. They refuse to even consider the fact that my payments should have been {$0.00} all along or that I had no knowledge the accounts weren't on the payment plan. I just don't understand why I would never have received anything until 6 months too late and they are unable to explain this to me either.",Student loan

The misapplication of payments ultimately led to my mortgage being placed into foreclosure at one point.

'' They also never resolved an issue I discovered about 2 years ago, when I learned that they had had me on an interest-only plan until XX/XX/XXXX, even though I had requested to be on a level plan. 

Below is a complaint I posted on the Consumer Affairs website in XXXX XXXX : I consolidated my loans at 4.75 % before graduating with an XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Since XXXX, I have been making monthly payments on my loans. Originally the lender was XXXX XXXX XXXX, but apparently AES acquired the loans in XXXX, XXXX when XXXX went out of business. I am concerned about several issues : I am charged late fees often, but without sufficient warning that my bill is due and that late fees will apply. These late fees are {$20.00}. XXXX had not served such high late fees. Also, AES is reporting these late payments to the credit report agencies, diminishing my credit - despite the fact that I pay monthly. I also frequently pay a greater sum than the minimum due - sometimes several times as much. I am concerned that these higher payments are not being applied toward the principal amount of my loan and I am not sure where the money is being applied. 

I estimate that I have paid at minimum {$20000.00}, likely {$25000.00}, to these XXXX lenders ( XXXX and AES ) over the past seven years. Yet my principal amount due has only decreased by about {$3000.00}. Though I have sometimes been on the interest-only plan, I have requested to be on the level plan for years. Yet I was just informed that I was on the interest-only plan until XXXX XXXX. Even if I were on an interest-only plan, at 4.75 % interest rate, this does not add up. Where has this money gone? On XXXX XXXX, I requested a full payment history from AES, including payments from XXXX, going back to XXXX. As of XXXX XXXX, I still have not received this payment history. I called AES on Tuesday, XXXX XXXX and was told that the request is "" being processed '' and that I should have it by Friday, XXXX XXXX.",Student loan

"Bank of America advertises very clearly : "" 3 % cash back in the category of your choice : gas, ONLINE SHOPPING, dining, travel, drug stores, or home improvement/furnishings '' For the past 2 years I have been using my BofA mastercard for doing online shopping believing that I was receiving the 3 % advertised cash back reward for my online purchases. 

According to the XXXX XXXX : online shopping ( noun ) : the action or activity of buying goods or services via the internet. 

This is pretty clear and obvious. However, BofA has a slew of exceptions as to what it considers "" online shopping '' For example, I ordered a set of contact lenses online. Through an online merchant. I engaged in ONLINE SHOPPING. However, BofA essentially excludes anything remotely related to a medical purchase as being eligible for the online shopping reward despite the purchase obviously being an act of ONLINE SHOPPING ''. 

The rewards page gives example of merchants where the 3 % rewards bonus can apply. Such as XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, etc. This is also misleading to the customer as all those merchants have their own car each at 5 % cash back and FREE SHIPPING. Why would a consumer benefit in using the the BofA card when they receive a higher benefit from using the merchant card? 

Hiding these details and labeling this benefit as for ONLINE SHOPPING is deceptive, manipulative, and most likely illegal. This benefit should be called "" online preferred merchant reward '' but of course that would not attract as many unknowing customers.

"Dear Friends at CPFB, I graduated from college back in XXXX  and soon after the Public Service Loan Forgiveness act was passed. I was very excited to hear about this program since I was over {$20000.00} in debt and excited to start my career as a woefully underpaid XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Graduating college while working full time was a huge and maddening endeavor on its own. Immediately after graduation, I then began scattering to find a job in my chosen career so that I can put my education to good use for the children of this nation and, hopefully, all of mankind. 

At some point after graduation and when the FSLP was being signed into law, I began getting phone calls from Citibank and put them off several times until, one day, I happened to have time to hear their sales pitch. They were very excited about the current low interest rates at the time and made me feel like it would be foolish not to consolidate my Federal Direct loans immediately, while the rates were so very low. 

I was young, naive, and this was my very first time owing money to anyone at all. I was overwhelmed at the time, very concerned about how I was going to afford the payments on this massive loan, and had zero experience in the real world. It sounded like it would really simplify my life and save me lots of money in the long term. I thought nothing of it and, of course, did it.

About 12 years later, I was so excited to finally hand in all the paperwork for my PSFL. I had worked tirelessly as an underpaid public servant and made my 120 payments only to find out that the loan that I now have ( that has since been transferred from Citibank to XXXX ) is not eligible for PSFL and that I would have to switch to a Federal Direct loan and start my ten years worth of service and payments all over again. 

I recently saw that the CPFB helped to find multiple legal violations on the part of Citibank, where they were fined a great deal of money. I greatly appreciate your agencys efforts in fighting for the people and truly hope that I can find similar recompense for this offense that I have encountered. 

I have a sneaking suspicion and strong belief that Citibank ( possibly in cahoots with our own government ) made a concerted effort to get young and naive new graduates to consolidate their loans in order to make sure that the loan never needed to actually be forgiven down the road. I was wondering if this was an issue that has ever been brought up by others and if there are any avenues for recourse for someone in my position. 

I guess that ultimately, I did not do my due diligence to assure that the loan consolidation was truly right for me. I wish that I was more wise and jaded back then and maybe I could have identified this rouse before being tricked like I was. But doesnt it seem odd that the interest rates happened to go way down immediately after the PSFL bill was passed and then immediately after, Citibank starts making relentless sales calls to lure people out of their direct loans. 

At the time, I was young and idealistic and would never expect the world to do such things to people, but now I feel like I have learned a lot more about the sad state of affairs in the profit at all cost financial system we live in and the whole thing sure seems like foul play to me.

All in all I am extremely disheartened to learn that I dedicated over ten years of my life in service of the public believing, all along, that I would be rewarded for my tireless efforts. I am tempted to just stop paying the loans, simply on principle and to give up my career in public service for more lucrative employment because I am seriously jaded and angry. I dont believe that this was the intended result when the lawmakers of the time passed this bill but, thus, here we are. 

I believe that I have affected and improved the lives of hundreds of children during my years as a XXXX  XXXX  and I would like to continue to do so. I am just at a crossroad now with my first child and a new partner who has XXXX boys of her own and it just feels like I may not be able to continue working for the insulting wages that teachers are paid in most of the country .... especially not after being as wickedly duped as I truly believe I have been.

To be able to graduate from the University XXXX in XXXX meant that student loans were going to be a part of my future. I had no idea that they would be this heavy a burden, or that they would grow so quickly with high interest rates. Navient 's total for my loans at this time is nearly {$32000.00}. 

Over the course of my loans since XXXX, I 've struggled to afford payments and several times have been forced into forbearance or into income-driven repayment plans even though I have worked jobs since being in college. Navient would n't allow me to stay in my income-driven repayment plan. They said the reason was changing policies that were out of my control. These new payment amounts are far beyond my means, even though I do have a job. The deadlines for certain forms had passed before I even knew they existed. 

I 've done my best in keeping these loans in good order and paying them off to the best of my ability. Navient has not helped in this and at times has made it harder to understand my options or answer my questions. Unresponsive when I contact them, however Navient sometimes contacts me several times per hour 24/7. I 've asked them to limit the calls which they do not. These calls can come from all across the states. 

Further, I 've done some research online which uncovers thousands of similar complaints and other shady activity that could have impacted me over the course of my loans so far. The kind of predatory lending techniques used on me and other students is appalling.

I 'm seeking relief in the form of aid and affordable options for handling my loans in the future. I 'm seeking relief in the form of an explanation as to why I have been targeted by Navient, being that student loan borrowers are some of the most vulnerable individuals with the most potential to be wasted. I 'm seeking to unite with others who have been wrongfully treated in order to find assistance and a voice.",Student loan

On XX/XX/XXXX, we had our closing schedule. While going through with the closing, I noticed that the new monthly payments had changed to {$1800.00}. 

I stopped signing the closing papers and called XXXX XXXX. He said he didn't get a chance to look at the documents before the closing and that he didn't have access to his PC as it was being worked on. 

I did not hear from him until later asking to have a conference call with him and his boss on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXXXX/XX/XXXX

They then continued to try and tell me that my existing mortgage company is not taking enough out in my escrow and that if I did not move forward with XXXX XXXX Mortgage, I would be short by more than {$1000.00} on my taxes for the next tax payment and that when that happened my existing mortgage company would either demand that I pay in full or spread it out in 6 months and that I would be better off moving forward.

I always check my account before making a purchase. Wells Fargo has always posted my transactions as pending and subtracts my purchase from my balance and I see how much i have left. As the pending transactions start to post something happens that I end up negative in my account and end up with an overdraft fee. Even though my transactions are pending they show my balance as if it was already taken out and supposedly it all depends on when the merchant puts the transaction through but then why put it as pending and actually subtract it from my balance if they are supposed to wait until it post. This has happened to me about 4 times already and it only seems to happen when I make a lot of purchases in a couple days time one after the other. When I make a lot of purchases they seem to get me with an old transaction from like a week ago telling me that it just posted and that's why I become overdraft. Everytime I make a purchase whether its online or in a store I always look at my account and make sure it went through and it Is at least pending and I see that it was subtracted from my balance and I see what balance I have remaining.

"I am writing in reference to a recent dispute with USAA and CFPB number XXXX. Someone named XXXX reached out on Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX and made multiple attempts to call her back and after she left a voice mail with no real solution regarding what really happened on the XX/XX/XXXX call and all the other recorded calls since XX/XX/XXXX. USAA has only attempted to camouflage the real issue which is their lack of true and genuine care for U.S. Veterans and I have been not had any resolution and believe there was no true intent being made to help me resolve the following issue below outlined in Case # XXXX : I made several attempts to resolve the debt issue with USAA regarding our policy, starting on XX/XX/XXXX when a representative took our payment for {$100.00}. to solve the cancellation issue and set up a recorded payment arrangement for {$180.00} per mth, prior to transferring me to the Auto Pay Plan Telephone Deployment line to set up auto-draft on the remaining amount. I was also told that some of the balance would carry over into the new policy renewal in XXXX and payment would adjust to higher amount. The special payment arrangement was set up because we informed the representative that our XXXX XXXX   account had received fraudulent activity and the account was closed and this was why the XXXX payment was delayed and, hence, was called in on XX/XX/XXXX. During this call we also expressed our extenuating circumstances and needed to continue a special payment arrangement and this is where the representative agreed to set up a special arrangement of $ XXXX/mth. I repeatedly requested if this was documented in the system and she confirmed and also confirmed with my husband as well to verify his account prior to us agreeing to the new amount of {$180.00} which was to come out of the account on XX/XX/XXXX. However, when we approached the week prior to XX/XX/XXXX, I was prompted to call USAA to ensure the payment was going to come out at {$180.00}, however, a representative informed me that they were planning to take out over {$1400.00} which is not what we had agreed upon on XX/XX/XXXX and I was very alarmed, upset and angry that USAA was going to attempt to take out this erroneous amount. I later informed the representative during this call, that the XX/XX/XXXX call was recorded and that someone needed to listen to the call to see where the discrepancy came between the company and the client because I know what I had agreed to during the call on XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been attempting to get this issue resolve regarding this illegal bait and switch which the company refused to listen to the original customer representative recordings from XX/XX/XXXX. Also, on XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by XXXX in Billing what occured on XX/XX/XXXX, and she went into the system to stop the payment of {$1400.00} and stated that she would have her manager XXXX XXXX call me back, however, did not receive a return call. After receiving no call back, I attempted to reach out to resolve this matter on several occasion. Each time I called in, I was provided with a work order numbers by the following billing customer service reps and told that someone would call me back within 24hrs to no resolve : XX/XX/ : 1.

Also, around XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX, I made another attempt to speak to a representative to get the matter resolved. I spoke to a femaile representative named XXXX based out of XXXX XXXX who stated she would call the USAA coproporate office to find out what was going on and stated she would call me back the following date. When she call me back the week of XX/XX/XXXX, she spoke extensively with higher level billing in USAA Corporate, and they agreed that if I made a downpayment, I could spread the remaining amount out over the new 6mth billing cycle. I was on the phone with XXXX for over 45minutes both days we spoke. She was the only one who went out of her way to try to get this resolved. However, when I called in this morning to make a payment of {$500.00}, and have the payment arrangement set up on the renewal, the representative saw the notations and stated he had to reach out to billing to set it up. However, when he returned to the line, he said the billing department informed him I could not set a payment plan and it was very confusing and alarming to me as a customer and U.S.  Veteran who has been part of USAA for over 7 years to receive this type of blatant and discriminatory treatement. I only wanted to get this resolved, however the representatives and management team have made it extremely difficult for me to make arrangements to pay my insurance. We should not be treated in such a biased manner and not allowed to make arrangements, since all of this originally commenced on XX/XX/XXXX where it points back to the customer service representative who specifically set up the arrangements for {$180.00} and no one has attempted to listen to the Actual Recordings from this call on XX/XX/XXXX or others since then.

"My initial concerns included real online reviews by actual customers. The online reviews by customers raised initial concern for me when I informed my mortgage was temporarily transferred to Sun West Mortgage Company. The reviews posted by actual customers do not mean the company is a bad company but they do suggest there is room for improvement. 
I noticed attempted use of advanced psychology to give the appearance of versus real, relevant customer service by including links to fake/ company created XXXX infomercials most likely by paid actors whose point of view and opinion will be slighted in biased favor of Sun West Mortgage Company . 
It is my opinion that someone dropped the ball by not processing an electronic payment I did for XX/XX/XXXX. I did an electronic payment I received an email confirmation and I also printed out/ did a print screen and pasted the info into MS paint to ensure I had a copy of the info. Sun West is claiming that there was incorrect routing or account number which I find hard to believe as I copied and pasted the account and routing from my online checking account to my online Sun West account when placing online payment to them and receiving payment confirmation. 
I was very hesitant to be transferred to a call center XXXX and discussing my financial information, unfortunately this normal for some companies versus keeping jobs in USA. The call center was not much help, they did not discuss what the issue was or why I was being contacted, only that I was being recorded for some unknown reason ( for XXXX, a radio show, who knows ). All the call center really did was transfer me to company rep voicemail. 
I was provided the toll free number of Sun West Rep with an extension number to speak to however I could never reach them. When calling the number the automated system indicated you needed to dial an extension or press XXXX for the operator. When you pres XXXX for operator the voice system takes you back to original recording, realistically you only have the option to dial extension which goes to VM every time. 
I attempted to make a online payment on via their website XX/XX/XXXX which Sun West Mortgage intentionally blocked and prevented on their website. It is my opinion that Sun West wanted to increase revenue from late fees by blocking my ability to pay online thus increasing likeyhood that I may need to pay past XX/XX/XXXX if needing to go to XXXX XXXX. I made a very reasonable attempt to pay on time, actually multiple times that Sun West Mortgage intentionally obstructed and prevented. I also noticed that Sun West Mortgage prevented me from printing the section of the webpage that showed the detailed information preventing me for paying online, I still did a print-screen and pasted in M.S. paint and saved the webpage as alternate ways to show the truth of what they did. 
SunWest called my parents asking them for payment in regards to my house payment something that should not have been done, is rude, and I did not appreciate. Due to the inability of Sun West Mortgage to send me detailed email or letter to home fax as requested point blank I requested they speak with my legal counsel which they refused to do. Due to enclosed factors in my complaint I am writing for federal investigation and resolution. 
I am no fool, it 's a home and the bank has many legal options as do I to resolve concern such as writing ( agency name ). As soon as I can go online in their system and pay them I will do so, whether or not Sun West Mortgage ( aka SunWest ) does what they are suppose to and should do to accept and process payments from customers has yet to be seen.

"I XXXX XXXX, have no choice but to submit a complaint against a nationally known vehicle finance company known as XXXX XXXX XXXX.

My argument is against an abusive derogatory placed on not only mine but my wifes credit report, with each respective credit reporting agencies, XXXX, rans Union and XXXX  respectively. I have had an impeccable payment history with XXXX XXXX XXXX since XXXX, as he attached credit reports shows Account Number XXXX opened XX/XX/XXXX, a perfect payment history until the vehicle was traded in for a new lease in XX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX XXXX XXXX is 100 % wrong on this back-dated latte payment, as once the lease was paid off by initiating a new vehicle lease for XXXX XXXX, FCRA was out of the equation and only collection remedies were in play through the FDCPA.

"On XXXX/XXXX/17, I went into Citibank located at XXXX in XXXX, VA - I was there to withdraw money from their ATM and to make an emergency deposit for someone. After withdrawing money, I proceeded to the teller window to make the deposit. The branch did not have deposit slips available, so I had to write the persons name and account number on a sticky note. The teller, XXXX, asked me if I had an account and I replied 'no '. She told me that I had to show a valid drivers license in order to make a deposit. I asked her why, because I was only depositing {$300.00}, and that I was n't requiring money back in change. She told me that it was required by the bank and Federal Government.

The branch manager, XXXX, asked me what the issue was. I explained to him that I was only making a deposit and why they needed my drivers license and personal information. He told me that it was required by Federal Government Law and it was bank policy. I asked for written literature of this or documentation but he did not have this information. It was basically verbal. I asked him if I could find this info on their website and he said its not available. I asked for the Corporate contact information and he said he could not provide this to me. I also asked if I could speak with the District Manager, but again he said that he could not give me that information because it was for internal employees only. He instead gave me the Customer Service number to speak with an agent. I told him that I would need to speak with a District Manager because I did not agree with their verbal policy regarding identification being required to make a deposit. He explained that it was the only way I could make this transaction unless I had a check - otherwise they would need my personal information if I did n't have my drivers license. I had to make the deposit, so I proceeded back to the teller 's window and presented my drivers license. She took the information and gave me a receipt. The transaction took about 10 minutes for her to enter my license and personal information. I asked her for the District Manager 's information and she said she did n't have it. She asked me to get it from the Branch Manager. I told her that I already spoke to him and that I was not granted that information. She then asked her colleague and was told to give me the manager 's email address. She gave me the email address and did not apologize for the inconvenience. I was concerned at this point because she initially told me that she did not have the managers information, and the branch manager said the same thing. After leaving the branch I called their customer service at XXXX. I asked to speak with a Supervisor and that I wanted to make a complaint. A supervisor named XXXX came to the phone after 10 minutes or so.

I told him that it was n't true because I made similar deposits at other banks like XXXX and XXXX, and they never asked for my license. He said that it was bank policy as well and it was for any amount of cash. I asked for the District Manager 's number and he told me that he could not give me that information. He said I could only file a complaint and that even if he called the manager, they would not answer the call. He then said that if I did not have my license I would need to provide my social security number and personal information. He told me that the bank did not have to post this policy anywhere nor online because it was Federal Law. The bank did not help me and treated me unfairly.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

I dont see how it is possible that SLS can try and initiate foreclosure proceedings against me, the rightful owner of the home, without even giving me the opportunity to work to resolve the matter. I am not able to repay the full past due amount in one large sum, but would like to work something out. I am the legal owner of the home, and this is a second mortgage. The first mortgage is current and we have no issues and I feel it would be much easier for Specialized Loan Servicing to attempt to work this out with me or to transfer the loan into my name. As it stands now they will receive nothingthey are in 2nd position and my ex-husband is not the rightful owner of the home so I dont see how they would have any legal grounds to foreclose, especially since I am trying to resolve the matter with them. I am contacting your agency to see if you can investigate the actions of SLS and assist in getting this logjam broken and getting the lender to recognize that even though my name is not on this loan, I was the rightful owner at the time of origination, I occupy the home and I am the rightful owner now and I have a court order that proves it. If I was not part of the equation for SLS, why would they serve legal paperwork to me?",Mortgage

"I would like to file a complaint against the investor on my home mortgage and servicer XXXX XXXX also known as Chase Mortgage. I refinanced in XX/XX/XXXX from a fixed mortgage with the current adjustable mortgage that I have right now. I was not properly disclosed what type of loan this was when I first got the loan. I found out later on that this phone was only supposed to be for short term investment properties not for residential homes in personal use.

in XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for a loan modification by the investor because the property was worth only {$400000.00} and my loan was XXXX at a time within a week I signed my documents and since then I have been making monthly mortgage payments on time regardless of my hardship. the loan modification that was given to me turn out to be as bad as the loan itself. 

when my loan was modified in XX/XX/XXXX I was not giving any principal reduction any favorable interest rate the only thing that seemed okay was the started rate. I truly believe that the investor gave me a loan modification to make sure I stay at the house take care of it until it built Equity again so they can foreclose on me in the future in capitalized on their investment.

I applied for a loan modification for XX/XX/XXXX after 6 months Asking for the same document multiple times I received a notice the loan modification was denied and the only offer they had for me was short sale. in their document they also encourages you not make monthly payment since you're in loan modification but that is only a tactic to make sure that you get foreclosed on as soon as possible especially if you missed payments. 



In XX/XX/XXXX I applied for loan modification now with a nonprofit organization to send all my documents to chase so I have a third party that is looking at my documents. today is XX/XX/XXXX. Chase Mortgage took almost 11 months to just review two months of bank statements and my one XXXX and the income that I receive on monthly basis for my family while I am struggling with my bills. for each document they asked 10 times or more that they don't have it and I had to refax everything all over again. I truly believe that is another tactic of the bank to make sure that you don't make the monthly payment so you are in foreclosure and you do not qualify for loan modification so it is easy for them to foreclose without any problems for them. 

I have documented all the violation that were done by Chase mortgage and XXXX XXXX my previous loan servicer as an example I will give you a few 1. the loan that I have was only designed for investors not for single-family resident with the teaser rate 2. XXXX XXXX /Chase placed a forced insurance policy on my mortgage without my knowledge and there was a class lawsuit action that was settled for breaking the law and anyone that was a part of the lawsuit action received a settlement and I was not the only victim ( I have all the documents that insurance policy was placed two months before the policy expire for double the price and the market {$2800.00} while the price of the insurance should be no more than {$1300.00} 2.In XX/XX/XXXX not only XXXX did not send me a 60 days notice for the interest rate changes on top of it Chase collected {$1600.00} from me for some type of Advance fees and I did tell the representative I didn't have the money and she said your house will go to foreclosure if you don't pay such face so I had to pay them immediately. again in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Chase including a check only because they were audited and that was a violation and they admitted to making a mistake and collecting the money from me and keeping it in their account. 
I still have that document. 


3. In XX/XX/XXXX again Chase never sent me any notice that my interest rate was going to go high in my monthly mortgage was going to change which is required by law that they must send out a 60 days notice to the homeowner to let them know that their payment will go up. I did not receive such document I only found out that my mortgage went up when I went to chase to make the monthly payment. I have all the paperwork that I will be more than happy to present in court to the judge when we go to court 4. My mortgage file is being audited by an attorney right now and I'm sure he will find other violations in my file that I don't have knowledge of since I'm not the expert on mortgage violation frauds.

5. my health is being affected by the games that are being played by the modification company and they have taken me to a total XXXX and I can not function because of all these problems that chase has caused in my life. I will present everything to the judge and let him make the decision. 

let me clarify I have made mortgage payments on timely manner to chase for the past 10 years regardless of my hardship and I wanted to live like a normal honest citizen and have a roof over my head but in this case Chase would like to court but it is okay for them to have violation because they're hoping that consumers will not protect themself but I am going to protect myself and I will let the court know about all their violation. 


like I clarified to XXXX XXXX XXXX modification before I am not short selling my house that is not an option for me. I also make the mortgage payment because I do not want to destroy my credit but they consist on me not making the payment and destroy my whole life so the investor could capitalize on the loan and make me homeless. I am going to court and I will sue them unless Chase does the right thing in modify my loan as they advertise instead of misleading people and actually taking them to foreclosure.",Mortgage

"I am in the middle of purchasing a home and late payments from Nelnet keep popping up on my XXXX and XXXX  reports. I have reached out via phone and email repeatedly over the last 3 months and received no response. 

I was delinquent in my student loans back in XXXX due to being laid off 4 times in a 2 year period.

Citibank did not send monthly statement. I did not know credit card had a balance. Because I was not sent a statement and did not make a payment Citibank charged me interest on the balance and a late fee for not making a payment on time.

"Back in XXXX, I purchased my first home in XXXX XXXX, WA with a mortgage from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 
As part of the mortgage, I setup a savings account, and setup Autopay to have my monthly dues automatically withdrawn from the checking account. Please note that I opted NOT to pay for insurance and taxes from an escrow account when setting up the mortgage. 

Fast forward to XXXX, I moved to a new city but kept the house in XXXX XXXX. Immediately upon my move, I changed the mailing address tied to my XXXX accounts from the website. I had not realized at the time that XXXX Mortgage kept separate addresses on file even though all records are accessed through the XXXX banking website, and because of this, the mailing address for the XXXX mortgage account was never updated. 

Sometime in XXXX, I switched to a different insurance company for the XXXX XXXX XXXX and informed XXXX of the change as instructed by the new insurance company. However, sometime in late XXXX, I received a phone call stating that I was behind on my mortgage payments. 
Several phone calls later, and upon closer review of my account, I found that XXXX force-purchased insurance claiming that I had not submitted proof of insurance. Because of the insurance that was purchased and the escrow that was created for it, my monthly dues had gone up, and the amount I had setup to for Autopay was just short of the new dues. 

While this was happening, XXXX apparently mailed me notices to my old mailing address on file but never once contacted me over the phone until way late in the game. XXXX also just held on to my monthly payments without processing them nor issuing a refund. 

In the end, I immediately paid the overdue amount and submitted proof to XXXX after which they issued a refund for the insurance and associated fees. XXXX also processed all of the funds that they were holding from payments they hadn't processed, so currently I am actually 3 months ahead of schedule in my payment. 

However, despite all of the above, my credit report still reflects that I had two major delinquencies in my payment which not only impacted my score, but have caused lenders to deny my refinancing application which will end up in tens of thousands of dollars in lost opportunity cost. 

I had filed disputes with all three insurance companies to no avail, so I'm asking CFPB to please step in and get this corrected as I have not missed a single payment.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"Was contacted by GM Financial 's collections department on or near XX/XX/18 or mid XX/XX/XXXX. Call was in regards to my XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$250.00} & XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$250.00} that they stated I was behind. I advised the represenative that I am aware that my due dates are the 1st of each month and have been paying toward the end of each month including an extra {$12.00} to cover any late fees. I explain that my 1st check of each month always go to my rent and that I pay all my other bills on my 2nd check in each month and that maybe a change in my due date would help. I was told that I am unable to change my due date because I was behind. I informed rep as well that I would pay XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX  payment including the {$12.00} late fees for both payments making total for me to pay of {$530.00} by XX/XX/18. Rep then advised that she could bring me current threw a deferment that I qualify for and said that this would be my final deferment for the year. I advised rep that if this would be my final deferment I would rather wait until I really would need it and was prepared to bring my payments current as stated on XX/XX/18. She then said that because XX/XX/XXXX payment would become due on XX/XX/18 she recommended again the deferment and said it would include XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX payment and said that would bring me current and not to change due date because now that I am current, if I usually pay toward end of each month my payments moving forward would actually be early instead of late. It made sense to me and I ok 'd rep to process deferment. Rep advised that I would have to make a deferment payment of {$170.00} which I informed her could not be made til XX/XX/18 which she said is fine and to call back once payment was made to process the deferment. I ended up getting off work on XX/XX/18 at XXXX and did make the deferment payment of {$170.00} on XX/XX/18 there after I called GM ' Financial customer service and spoke to a rep to make sure they saw the payment made of {$170.00} which she confirmed that she did see and to call back on monday XX/XX/18. I called customer service on XX/XX/18 and rep acknowledged that they received my deferment payment and rep confirmed that it would cover XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX payment. Rep also stated that I will not get any bill in XX/XX/XXXX and to continue on time with my normal payment of {$250.00} as of XX/XX/18. Around mid XX/XX/XXXX I receive a call from GM 's collections department stating that my XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$190.00} is due? When I explained the whole matter about the deferment I was given by rep and had paid, they simply said that was wrong info and that I owe {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX? I requested for a manager and did speak to manager name XXXX. I explained everything to her. I advised that I did not receive any bill for XX/XX/XXXX like the rep who processed my deferment stated and that the only thing I had received was a letter stating they received my deferment payment of {$170.00} and that the deferment was processed and mentioned to manager that I was also concerned that the deferment letter did not show the months I am defered for. Manager then said that Delaware state laws states they do not have to provide that info. I also advised her that my normal payment each month are {$250.00} and if they are stating I only owe {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX how was that possible. Manager advised because of an over payment made in XX/XX/XXXX? She also stated that the deferment only covered me for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payment? I informed her how was it an over payment made in XX/XX/XXXX when I was told deferment was to cover me for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX payment. Manager started getting fustrated with me said bottom line is that I owe the {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. I advised that I will not pay {$190.00} and that I need this straighten before any other payments are made and also that I will file a complaint with the CFPB. When I mentioned that her whole additude changed stating that she was willing to waive any late fee 's etc. I advised her that I will call back to speak to someone higher than her. On XX/XX/18 I called in to Gm Financial and asked to speak to someone higher than a manager, then the same manager XXXX was online and I advised her that I wanted to speak to someone higher than her and she said that she would transfer me to the SR. VP of consumer affairs for their company, party name was XXXX . I was forwarded to her voicemail and had requested a return call on XX/XX/18 and advise best to reach me by XXXX or XXXX est and would take a lunch break to discuss this with her. I received call from XXXX on XX/XX/18 at around XXXX-XXXXest. I explained everything to her. XXXX admitted that she did see notes that rep did state that deferment would cover me for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and also saw that I was told to pay the deferment amount of {$170.00}. But stated that was wrong info that the rep gave me. She basically stated the same thing that they will not honor the original deferment agreement that their rep offered me? I informed her that she should have listened to the calls first before calling me and also should have had the info on why they are stating I owe {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. She said she did not have my info in front of her, which I found strange because she was aware that she was calling me back in regards to a complaint. She asked me to give her time to listen to the call and gather all her notes and we scheduled to speak on XX/XX/18. I received call from XXXX on XX/XX/18 and she stated that the President of the consumer affairs department sat down with her to pull those calls but none of them was recorded? And that he ruled that XX/XX/XXXX payment of {$190.00} was due. I asked if she looked into the over payment they stated was made in XX/XX/XXXX that caused me only to owe {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX payment. And she said she did not have the info in front of her. When I questioned about the over payment advising her that if I paid in XX/XX/XXXX why did rep offer the deferment if all I owed was XX/XX/XXXX? XXXX then started to be impatient with me because she could not answer my question and said she would mail me my payment history. I advised her that even after all this as a customer who did exactly what rep advised me to get me current was a waste of my money because I am still behind. I advised XXXX that as a customer and even with her admitting that she saw the notes where the rep confirmed that I would be covered for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, you would think that they would do the right thing and honor the deferment agreement that I was given. She advised that they would waive any late fee 's but that I still owe {$190.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. I advised her that I will file complaint with the CFPB. She said if I have attorney to have them call in. I did receive payment history which I did include, along with my bill dated XX/XX/2018. I noticed it shows I made a payment in XX/XX/XXXX of {$270.00}. I went to XXXX website to see if other customers have experienced this and there was several of the same complaints filed.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

"Dear Sirs, The following is based on a letter written from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and applies to any of my accounts that may have gone delinquent in the wake of the Pandemic Covid-19 : The CARES Act places special requirements on companies that report your payment information to credit reporting agencies. These requirements apply if you are affected by the coronavirus pandemic and if your lender gives you an accommodation to defer a payment, make partial payments, forbear a delinquency, modify a loan, or other relief. 
If your lender does make an agreement or accommodation with you : How your lenders report your account to credit reporting agencies under the CARES Act depends on whether you are current or already delinquent when this agreement is made. These reporting requirements apply only if you are making any payments required by the agreement. 
If your account is current and you make an agreement to make a partial payment, skip a payment, or other accommodation, then the creditor is to report to credit reporting companies that you are current on your loan or account. 
If your account is already delinquent and you make an agreement, then the creditor can not report you as more delinquent ( such as reporting you as 60 days delinquent when you started out 30 days delinquent ) during the period of the agreement. 
If your account is already delinquent and you make an agreement, and you bring your account current, the creditor must report that you are current on your loan or account. 
This CARES Act requirement applies only to agreements made between XX/XX/2020 and the later of either : 120 days after XX/XX/2020 or 120 days after the national emergency concerning COVID19 ends. 
If your lender does NOT give you an accommodation : In addition, the special comment is temporary and may only show on your account for a period of time, such as during the time of a declared national emergency. When the lender stops furnishing the special comment information, it disappears permanently and entirely from your credit report. There will be no record that there was ever a special comment placed on your credit report. 
The CARES Act also applies to certain federal student loans and includes requirements relating to suspending payments and credit reporting. During the period that payments on federal student loans are suspended by the Department of Education, any payment that has been suspended is to be reported as if it were a regularly scheduled payment made by the borrower. ( any increase in the balance of the loan is invalid.

"I, XXXX XXXX, the sole mortgage holder of loan # XXXX for property XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ca XXXX that was recently being serviced under PHH Mortgage service but now been paid off by an unauthorized 3rd party without the consent or use from me of my personal usage of my information. PHH mortgage has not addressed nor resolved my prior complaints filed against them under FTC. 
My complaint against PHH Mortgage is they have continually given out my person information regarding my loan info. to a 3rd party unauthorized party. I was told by thier own representative on the customer service line in XX/XX/XXXX that an attorney XXXX XXXX that is not any attorney of mines contacted PHH Mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX requesting my payoff amount on my loan and I was told by Phh Mortgage representative that they did indeed give my payoff info to this unauthorized person that has no court order or consent of mines to get my payoff information. 
My question is why did phh mortgage give out my personal info once again to an unauthorized party? They continue to violate my rights of privacy and my own chapter XXXX  bankruptcy of the debt that has been discharged back in XX/XX/XXXX under XXXX # XXXX and no one should be doing any service under my debt at this point without my consent. 
However, it came to my attention my debt was now paid off in full in XX/XX/XXXX by an unauthorized 3rd party without my consent or knowledge which was told to me by a phh representative in XX/XX/XXXX. So I spoke with an escalation manager in XXXX XXXX regarding this situation to return the {$200000.00} back to whom ever paid off my debt. I did not want my loan paid off due to tax purpose. Phh Mortgage stated they do not know who paid off the loan, it was wired to them but they would look into the matter and request all monies be returned. However it is a whole month later and no money has been returned. I keep getting the run around it has to go through different departments for approval and once this is done they will return the money to the sender. 
I have never gave consent for anyone to assume my loan and I did not refinance my loan or consent for anyone to use my personal info to refinance my debt that has already been discharged. If phh mortgage was not giving my personal info out to others in the first place this illegal transaction could not have been carried out. 
At this point, I do not feel phh mortgage has any intention to return money to unauthorized persons. I dont feel they wouldnt care if someone robbed a bank to pay off the debt, as long as they got their money. They certainly don't care about giving out my personal information and I am filing this complaint once again for FTC to look into their practice. 
What I want answer and resolved by phh mortgage which still has not been responded to is : 1. Have phh mortgage address why did they give out my payoff info to attorney XXXX XXXX without my authorization which they now trying to cover up happened and play XXXX? Although they rep told my by phone back in XX/XX/XXXX. 
and 2. When are they going to return the {$200000.00} back to the unauthorized 3rd party sender as they have stated to me? 
Once again, I did not give my consent for anyone to do anything with my loan. Not assume it nor refinance it. Imy debt had already been discharged and no one had a right to do anything under my loan without my consent or court order. 
3. I'm requesting ftc take necessary steps to penalize this mortgage company for violating my rights to privacy and my own bankruptcy discharge.",Mortgage

"After depositing {$150000.00} in XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX2016, ( some of which we managed to have returned to us through our own efforts ), into an overseas trading platform that turned out to be a scam, we disputed the charges with Chase, as we never received what we had paid for. Chase strung us along and closed the dispute twice after which the Executive Office reviewed it, admitted we were correct and told us it was too late. We opened a complaint with the CFPB ( Complaint # XXXX ) and Chase responded, once again ignoring the glaring facts and blatantly disregarding valuable information to our case. Below is our complaint against Chase.
1 ) Chase sent us copies of all of the paperwork that they based their decision off of. It was dishonest of Chase to neglect to include the contract which states that our final deposit of {$100000.00} would not be included in the original bonus agreement and the funds would be liquid and available for withdrawal at any time. This is obstruction of justice on Chases part. Additionally, XXXX did not live up to any of the other terms that are stated in the legally binding contract. Chase was told on the phone by a representative of XXXX that the funds would be refunded. The funds were never refunded, and Chase never followed up on it.
2 ) If the reason Chase neglected to include this contract in their files is because Chase does not wish to recognize XXXX emailed contract as legally binding, then Chase needs to acknowledge that they are giving credence to a lying, scheming, dishonest company who made a worthless agreement with us in order to defraud us.
3 ) Chase claims we agreed to a contract. This contract includes that we would be able to trade currencies on their portals. Their portal is not a portal. Its not in real time. It is fake. They did not live up to their side of the terms at all. Therefore, the contract is not legally binding because of fraud in the inducement. The reason why this is fraud in the inducement is because XXXX told us we would be making trades and the understanding was that this would be on a real-time portal on the actual market. In fact, its their own portal which they control in order to cause you to trade away your money. XXXX intent is to mislead unsuspecting consumers. We would have never entered into a contract with this merchant had we known that they were a dishonest and fraudulent company who was selling a fake portal. As soon as we realized, we contacted Chase who was very unhelpful and uninformative regarding how to get our money back.
4 ) Chase asked us to submit proof from a financial professional that the portal was fake and that XXXX XXXX obligations were not met and therefore the services were not rendered. We provided the necessary information ( proving how XXXX was manipulating the numbers and the portal was not in real time ) and Chase said that the information was sufficient but it was too late. This is not in accordance with what they had told us earlier.
5 ) XXXX did not abide by their own contract and the representatives at Chase told us straight out that theyre a dishonest company and many others have had similar problems. If this is the case, then this company should not be allowed credit card privileges and Chase should not have allowed our charges to go through in the first place.
6 ) It is laughable that Chase claims the contract is legally binding, when it was no problem for XXXX XXXX XXXX who immediately recognized the credence of our complaints to withdraw the money we charged on their card directly from XXXX.
7 ) Chase had clear intent to misguide us through the disputes process until it was too late so they would not lose money.
8 ) Chase is guilty of conspiracy and accessory to theft for validating and upholding fraudulent contracts and a fake business. Chase took advantage of us because they knew we would be powerless against their large corporation.",Credit card or prepaid card

"I have two major issues : 1. Despite numerous attempts to consolidate all my loans under one company, I have been unable to do so. 

I have {$270000.00XXXX under Navient ; and three separate loans for {$24000.00} under Nelnet and one for {$3400.00} under Debt Collection.  The reason I did not originally include these other loans under Navient initially is that I was advised by a Navient customer service representative that these loans would not qualify for an Income-Driven Payment Plan request once the consolidation was completed. I was later told by a separate customer service representative that this was not correct information. At any rate, I am unable to modify the consolidation to included these items and the separate payments I am being requested to pay is going to be very XXXX over time. 

2. Navient 's determination that I am able to make 9 payments of {$1500.00}, 124 payment of {$2700.00} and 9 payment of {$1700.00} from XXXX until XXXX is incredibly unrealistic and will lead me to bankruptcy. 

Despite numerous attempts to select a reasonable monthly payment of approximately XXXX XXXX monthly given my income and financial obligation -- the payment schedule they send me does not truly take into account my REAL discretionary income. Their definition for discretionary income is income which exceed 150 % of the poverty guidelines. In XXXX the poverty level for a family of three is {$37000.00}. If you multiply this number by 150 % they are saying that I have approximately {$58000.00} in discretionary income given that my gross salary is {$100000.00} annually or {$4800.00} per month. So totally, not the case.
My net pay per month is {$4700.00}.
My monthly expenses are approximately {$4100.0XXXX. See below : XXXX XXXX {$2400.00} XXXX XXXX {$70.00} XXXX {$280.00}  XXXX XXXX XXXX {$150.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$140.00} XXXX {$280.00} XXXX {$160.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX {$70.00} XXXX XXXX {$120.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX {$72.00} XXXX XXXX XXXX 1 {$100.00} HXXXX XXXX XXXX 2 {$25.00} Total XXXX These two items are taken from my gross income XXXX XXXX XXXX$410.00} XXXX XXXX {$73000.00} Total {$5200.00} Please keep in mind that food, gas, car maintenance, etc. are not even included. 

I NEED HELP!!!!! No one at Navient is listening or seems to care. I do not want to file for XXXX but may be headed down that path if I can not get the REPAYE payment plan of {$620.00} per month which was offered when I completed the electronic Income-Driven Payment Plan request.",Student loan

"I applied for a Fifth Third Essential Checking account online on XXXX/XXXX/2016. My application was approved online and funded on that day. I opened the account because of the sign-up bonus for {$200.00}, which would be deposited after 90 days after completing the following : Qualifying activity includes XXXX online bill payments using Fifth Third Bank 's online bill payment service AND direct deposit. The monthly maintenance fee would be waived for the account if Maintain a combined monthly average balance of {$1500.00} across your deposit and investment accounts. I funded the account to maintain the {$1500.00} balance, but was charged the monthly maintenance fee each month. When I called Fifth Third to have the fees reversed, they reversed one month. When I called customer service again to check on the status of my bonus, after the 90 days have passed and I have completed the bonus terms, they stated that I did not open an Essential Checking account, but a Basic Checking account, which is not eligible for the bonus. I also inquired to have another month 's maintenance fee reversed and they stated that the Basic Checking account can not have the fees waived. I asked why I was placed into the Basic account when I applied for the Essential and they could not provide me with an answer. When I requested to have the account closed and transferred into the Essential Checking, they stated this account can not be closed until a year has passed. 

I contacted the local branch and spoke with XXXX XXXX and explained what had happened. He stated that he would reverse the monthly maintenance charges that were not reversed and close the Basic Checking account and transfer my funds into the Essential Checking account. He opened the Essential Checking account on XXXX/XXXX/16 and kept the Basic Checking account open until I received my debit card. I called XXXX again on XXXX/XXXX/16 stating that I have not received my debit card and to confirm the mailing address. Once confirmed, he said he would mail the card out again. On XXXX/XXXX/16, I emailed XXXX stating that I still have not received my card and would like my account closed and all maintenance fees refunded. In his response, he stated that two months were previously refunded and he would close my account. 

In the Basic Checking, I received 5 monthly maintance charges at {$8.00} each. There was a reversal of {$7.00} and {$8.00}. I was placed into the Basic Checking account without my knowledge or consent. I believe this is a deceptive practice.","Bank account or service, Savings account"
"On XX/XX/2020, I fell victim to a scam by XXXX XXXX XXXX, masquerading as an auto vehicle dealer-ship. Money was transferred from my TD Bank account via bank transfer in the total amount of XXXX USD. I was looking for a vehicle for my dad. His car is very old and I wanted to surprise him for his XXXX birthday. He has always wanted to have a full-sized pickup truck, but the house, XXXX kids, college tuition, and all of the other bills prevented him from ever getting that truck. He would always put his family first and himself second. 

I wanted so badly to get him that truck. I was looking online for available vehicles and came across XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They claimed their vehicles were seized or repossessed and were therefore sold at lower prices. I saw an XXXX XXXX XXXX and began to inquire. The people claiming to be from XXXX were very polite. They would send me a copy of every conversation we had. They answered me throughout the entire process. 

They told me I could pay in cash but only at their location in Michigan. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a bill and information on where to send a wire transfer. I sent the wire for {$4700.00} and awaited instructions. Even after the money was sent they would still answer my questions via online chat. They arranged a delivery date with me. As the delivery appointments were missed they would tell me that they had to contact the shipping company or the driver was delayed. Needless to say, the vehicle never showed up and eventually my questions received no answers. 

I am extremely embarrassed about this. I had to explain to my wife that I wasted all of that money. Money that we didn't have to just throw away. My dads birthday came and went and it broke my heart that I wasn't able to get him that truck. Being down all of that money, now I definitely couldn't afford to look into another truck. 

I would never think to steal from another person, so I trust people when I shouldn't. There are so many bad people out there that it just gets very disheartening. If there is any way I can recover any of the funds, any of it at all, I would be so appreciative.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

"We ran into 2 different problems with Chase as a customer of theirs. The first issue is that we opened a business account with them which had a promotion going that you would earn {$150.00} after several qualifications were met. One of the qualifications was that you had to deposit {$500.00} into the account within 10 days of opening the account. Our account was opened in branch, and we had cash with us to make the deposit for the promotion, but the Chase banker told us it was n't necessary, and we would meet the qualifications with a transfer since it counts as a new deposit if the account the transfer comes from is not on the new account. Per the Chase banker 's instruction at account opening we transferred {$600.00} into the account and we were specifically told we would be eligible for {$150.00} provided we left the money in the account for 60 days. We did, and after 60 days Chase informed us that despite what we were told at account opening, and despite the fact the banker initiated the transfer for the sole purpose of satisfying this qualification of the promotion, it did not in fact meet the requirements and we were not eligible for the {$150.00} bonus we were promised at account opening. The qualification specifically states it has to be a new deposit, however the Chase Banker told us at account opening that the transfer he performed at account opening from a different account owner qualified as a new deposit. Since we actually brought cash with us into the bank specifically for the purpose of depositing the money for the account bonus, it 's incredibly deceptive that we were talked out of doing the very thing that apparently would have qualified us for the bonus, while simultaneously being told that the transfer would qualify us when it apparently did n't. As of now, Chase refuses to honor the bonus that was promised to us at account opening. 
A second issue is based on a dispute from a debit card charge. We purchased glasses from a site that appeared to be an honest business. The site had an almost identical website address, and the appearance of the site was completely identical to the correct merchant website. It was obviously meant to deceive people who accidentally visited the counterfeit site, masquerading as the original business. When the merchandise arrived it was not what we ordered, and was quite obviously counterfeit, and the charge that appeared on the statement was from XXXX. We disputed the charge with Chase, and they requested additional documentation from us supporting our claim that the product was counterfeit. We were given only 9 days ( from receipt of the letter ) to provide this documentation, before Chase decided against us. The first documentation sent to Chase was apparently lost by Chase despite being faxed to them directly from a Chase branch. Once re-sent, they waited another 3 weeks before ruling against us yet again despite the fact we sent them the exact documentation they required. We provided to Chase a written letter from the original manufacturer that the merchant who sold us the merchandise was a counterfeit site. Furthermore, on a three-way phone call with the manufacturer with Chase on the phone, they stated to Chase that based on price alone the items were clearly counterfeit. The manufacturer also provided contact information if Chase had any additional questions or concerns. Despite all of this, with no explanation given whatsoever, Chase again denied the claim.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute.

Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18U.S.C. 1621.

It is my official statement that someone and/or several people have opened these accounts and made transactions on these accounts without my knowledge or authorization, my personal information has been used to obtain goods, services, or money : and the person ( s ) responsible for creating these accounts. 

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person. 

In addition, it has also been discovered that these STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within my credit file. The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine.

"I rec 'd a declination letter from XXXX re. my request for an increase in my credit limit per the card I have with them. In that my payment history with them was pristine and that XXXX suggested that, if I wanted, I could get, from the reporting agency itself, a copy of the credit report and score that they drew upon to make the determination in rejecting my request, I then called that agency, ( Transunion ) and was given the 'opportunity ' to leave a voicemail and decided instead to go to the online website for the reporting company that XXXX had also included in the contact info for such agency. 
When I did, I saw various 'offers ' that were apparent attempts to misdirect me from getting my report and score for free..

I struggled to make the site function in a manner to accord with the Fair Credit Reporting Act dictate per the providing, in my circumstance, a free score, but could not accomplish such. It is pretty clear to me that the site was designed to thwart attempts to gain a free copy of the scoreand frankly it is also pretty clear that this is a violation of the aforeref 'd to act.

T he interest rate on the loan was 28 %, however the dealership explained to me that I could always make a payment to Principal only in order to pay the loan down faster. In the following days I spoke with  American Credit Acceptance direc tly and asked them about the terms of the loan and also if payments could be made to Principal only. They confirmed to me over the phone that Principal only payments were accepted. From this point I have always paid the car note on time using their online payment system ( which charges an abusive and additional  XXXX  dollars per month to use ).

The rep asked me if I had been a member of any gym recently and I replied XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX  where I have resided since XXXX before relocating from XXXX where I had lived from XXXX. I ended the call stressing that I never had a membership or account with any gym by that name and that this was not my debt. 



Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received credit alerts from credit monitoring services stating that a collections account was added to my credit report. When I checked XXXX ( screen shot included with this complaint ), it shows a Collection Account with date opened XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$250.00} ( rounded up from the {$250.00} First Credit claimed I owed ), but the Original Creditor is listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX, the information I volunteered to their representative, not on the bill they sent ( copy included with this complaint ).

He received CFPBs status update stating that the Company responded on XX/XX/XXXX stating the following : We are in receipt of the referenced complaint and appreciate the opportunity to resolve the consumers concern.

Now today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a falsified collections account on my credit report from First Credit Services. 



To resolve this situation, the First Credit Services needs to have this false collections account removed from my credit report and assert that this is not my debt. 



Further, I recommend that as a federal agency, CFPB have First Credit Services investigated broadly for these business practices. The systematic way in which First Credit tried to collect fraudulent fees from my household wreaks of a concerted effort rather than a simple error on the part of their client. Gyms are closed during COVID-19, and XXXX  offered us the opportunity to freeze our membership which we did so that we would not incur charges for services that we could not use due to public health mandates. First Credit appears to be perhaps taking advantage of the COVID crisis, claiming people owe their clients money.

"Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. The below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that, I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement of omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18 U.S.C. 1621.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so.

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency, and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

It has also been discovered that these STUDENT LOAN ACCOUNTS were also being listed within m
y credit file. The fact is that these Student Loan Accounts are not mine. I did not open these accounts and did not even seek a high education or attend college. So these accounts do not belong to me.

According to the FAIR CREDIT REPORTING ACT "" FCRA '' 611 ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ), Procedure In Case of Disputed Accuracy ...

( a ) Reinvestigations of Disputed Information ( 1 ) Reinvestigation Required ( a ) In general. Subject to Subsection <t,, if the completeness or accuracy of any item of information contained in a consumer 's file at a consumer agency is disputed by the consumer and the consumer notifies the agency directly, or indirectly through a reseller, of such dispute, free of charge, conduct a reasonable reinvestigation to determine whether the disputed information is inaccurate and record the current status of the disputed information, or delete the item from the file in accordance with paragraph ( 5 ), before the end of the 30day period beginning on the date on which the agency receives the notice of the dispute from the consumer or reseller.

Therefore, my position is being clearly stated, these accounts do not belong to me, meaning that you are reporting inaccurate account information within my credit file. The fact that these are inaccurate account information means that you, this credit reporting agency, are reporting incorrect accounts. 

Finally, you are reporting the INQUIRIES that are the result of the same type fraudulent activities. I must be noted that I did not apply for credit accounts with the below listed companies and creditors, some of these are the result of attempts to open accounts, but the companies did not approve these accounts. Therefore, these inquiries must be deleted from within my credit file. You can not delete the fraudulently opened accounts without also deleting the fraudulent inquiries. 

Inquiries that are made by someone else without my authorization is not a factual record of access to my credit file, it is a factual record of fraudulent activity, and it must be addressed as such. The reason that these inquiries are being disputed is because they were not made by me, and when I report this to you, it is your responsibility to investigate my claims, and when you can not prove that these inquiries were made by me, they must be removed from my credit file. It is not my responsibility to go directly to each creditor, the obligation lies at your feet because you are reporting inaccurate information within my credit report, and this violates the FCRA. 

It should be noted that an inquiry that was not made by me is not a factual record, just as a fraudulently opened account is not a factual record and not referred to the creditor to be disputed directly with them. The credit reporting agencies have attempted to address an inquiry as a factual record of file access, but if it was done through fraudulent means, it is not a factual record. As a consumer I should not be required to dispute each fraudulent inquiry directly with each company. These inquiries are the result of fraudulent activity and therefore inaccurate information in which the credit reporting agencies or the creditors can not verify, meaning that these inquiries are unverifiable information and must be deleted from out of my credit file. 

INQUIRIES : I am well aware of my rights as a consumer. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that you, the credit-reporting agency, report accurate and/or correct account information within my credit file. My credit issues are very specific, these accounts and/or items do not belong to me. This means that you are reporting incorrect account information within my credit report. It is with this in mind that I request that these listed accounts and items be BLOCKED and DELETED!

"I made a $ XXXX principal payment on my mortgage in 2019. Wells Fargo has done creative accounting and failed to credit my account for the proper amount paid. Instead they continued to charge my interest on the high balance. I have complained several times and then they tried to fix the issues, but continues to do creative accounting. To date I still have not received money back for interest paid nor is my balance fixed. They claim the money was used to pay taxes or insurance, which the $ XXXX was only to go towards the principal amount. This is not the first time Wells Fargo has done creative accounting on my account. I keep paying and my balance is hardly ever lower in the past 15 years. Forensic accounting needs to be done on my account and Wells Fargo should have to pay a penalty for doing this! If I am not pursuing this, Wells Fargo would get away with this fraud!!!!","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"
"I had autopay set up for my credit card to pay the entire balance on the due date. This had been working fine for the previous due dates. But my last due date, they changed the autopay to just the minimum balance. I saw the payment go through so then I paid the additional remaining billing amount on the same due date, which was a Sunday. Then BofA charged interest on my balance since the payment didn't post until Monday. I reached out to them and they credited my account for the interest, but I want this to go on the record because this probably happens to a lot of customers and they just pay the interest.",Credit card or prepaid card
"Somewhere on or around XX/XX/XXXX My estranged husband, XXXX XXXX XXXX and I were issued a check from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for musical instruments he claims were stolen after our separation on XX/XX/XXXX. The check was paid to the order of XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$4900.00}, check XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX was able to take the check to a JP Morgan Chase branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas and deposited into his personal bank account without my signature or knowledge. This check was allowed to be improperly negotiated and deposited. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX a check was issued to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. JP Morgan Chase at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Texas XXXX allowed him to cash this check without my knowledge or signature as well as Compassion 's roofing did not sign the check XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX for {$3000.00}. 

On or around XX/XX/XXXX JP Morgan Chase allowed check XXXX. {$3000.00}, dated XX/XX/XXXX to be cashed. This check was made out to XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX and XXXX Roofing & Remodeling. 

All 3 of these checks were not negotiated properly, but all three were either deposited or cashed by 3 branches of JP Morgan Chase. 

I have spoke to several branches of JP Morgan Chase and all say it was incorrect, but there is nothing that can be done about it. The second two checks with the contractor 's name was for roof repairs ( both checks were the same amount ), but no work has been done on the property. I believe XXXX XXXX and the contractor may have split the money or XXXX XXXX may have kept the money for his gain. Please understand I know this money is not mine, but should have gone for the roof repairs. More checks are to be issued for the repair. I have spoken many time to our mortgage companies Loss Draft Department and although they admit the signing of the checks was improper they say they can not do anything about it and will reissue more checks without inspection of property repairs. 

I have spoke to JP Morgan Chase branches, XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( as checks were drawn off them ) with no resolution. 

It is my conclusion that anyone can walk into a JP Morgan Chase branch and cash/deposit whatever they want without recourse.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

"For two months now, my debit card continually is denied despite availability of funds in my primary account. Wells Fargo has stated repeatedly that the issue is 'on their side ' and each and every call to customer care ( there have been 7 calls ) I am told they 'refresh the card ' and that the problem is fixed on their end -- except it is not. My card is rejected at point of sale, at ATM, and online. When I ask a business or service to 'please re-run the card ' -- 50 % of the time the transaction will go through. 
Wells Fargo finally sent me a replacement card and stated it would solve the problem -- it did n't. At first Wells Fargo stated that again, on their side, the card was refreshed and that I should n't have any problems. I even drove to an ATM with them on the phone to prove that the card would not work. 
I have filed a complaint with Wells Fargo but nothing get 's done. I have escalated. All they will do is tell me that they are 'doing what they can on their side ' but yet nothing is getting fixed.

"To Whom It May Concern : On XX/XX/2016 I attempted ( unsuccessfully ) to withdraw ( drive-up ATM ) {$300.00} from my American Express ( Serve ) credit card ( hereinafter AMEX ) - via my local community bank retail branch ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, MA ). After correctly inserting my AMEX Credit Card, entering correct PIN #, requesting {$300.00} cash ( sufficient funds in account ) and agreeing to XXXX XXXX and AMEX ATM transaction fee ( s ), the ATM locked-up and shut down, never dispensed any cash whatsoever ( {$0.00} ), and would n't release my credit card. I immediately went in to the bank 's branch, informed Branch Manager of what happened and assistant was able to get my credit card - but no cash ( as requested ). I complained to Branch Manager, then went home and logged in to my AMEX account. My AMEX account had been debited ( same day and time ) for a total sum of {$300.00} from the failed transaction ( {$300.00} cash requested, {$2.00} AMEX withdrawal fee and {$2.00} XXXX XXXX ATM fee. Then I went back to bank branch and was informed that I would have to file a dispute directly with AMEX ( informed by Branch Manager required by federal law via some Regulation E ). The following day ( XX/XX/2016 ) Branch Manager informed me that the funds I requested had been received by them from AMEX and that ( per Regulation E ) they had to wire same amount back to AMEX. So I correctly completed and faxed AMEX 's XXXX-page dispute form. Several days thereafter I received a "" provisional credit '' from AMEX for {$300.00} ( within the 10-day period ). Several days later I received e-mail notification from AMEX that I lost the dispute ( was found guilty ) and the funds would be taken back ( my account debited ) on XX/XX/2016 ( which they did ). I was so upset I almost had a XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). In closure, I 've been ripped-off a total of {$300.00}, and from my perspective it 's outright theft ( stealing ). By what company I do n't know ( 3rd party ATM transactional processors, etc. ). As much as XXXX XXXX staff sincerely tried to help and advise me, neither XXXX XXXX nor I know of what company the credit ended up with. AMEX customer service ( off-shore in-bound customer service call center ) will not, or possibly can not, provide XXXX XXXX and/or myself any contact person or phone # for anyone in the AMEX dispute department. I 've repeatedly called and repeatedly told the case is closed, and nothing can be done.

"In XXXX of XXXX I bought my first car a XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have since been a loyal customer of XXXX XXXX with no late payments. I typically make my XXXX payments at the beginning of each month to XXXX in the amount of {$180.00}. In XXXX of XXXX I did my typical routine where I pay all my bills which what I believed at that moment that I was good to go until the next month. On XXXX XXXX, 30 days after XXXX payment was due I receive my FIRST and ONLY notification that they did not receive my payment. I immediately go into my usual process into paying all my bills including the XXXX XXXX loan. I pay the amount due of {$380.00} which is the two payments plus one {$20.00} late payment. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I start chatting with my XXXX  and I check my credit as I have been actively checking during a XXXX purchasing search and I notice a 100 point drop in my credit score. 100 points for 1 missed payment. I have never missed a payment in my life and I had my credit score drop 100 points. 

I franticly call XXXX XXXX on that same Monday ( XX/XX/XXXX ). They explain that it was late and they can only report the facts. I explain that I know this is true, but that there was no communication, no heads up, other then a notice when it was too late. I explain that there has to be a better way to tell someone they have not paid then a mailed letter when its already too late. I explained that this seems like a petty way of handling a loyal customer who had no previous issues. I continued to explain that this issue is going to cause me house purchasing issues when to me it seemed reasonable to re-age the credit due to lack of communication. The lady I speak to agrees that it was wrong, and is not fair but says she can not do anything and recommends I complain to corporate. 

On that same Monday I call each of the three credit bureaus ( XXXX, Experian, and XXXX ) and after plenty of automated messaging I finally speak to someone from each company. They each say the same thing and asking me to speak to the lender ( XXXX XXXX  ) I continue to let them know that I have and that they will not do anything, so at this point I am just trying to do damage control. I ask them WHY 100 points. It seemed extreme to me. I have missed ONE payment and it is now going to drop my credit score 100 points causing issues in my home purchasing process. This missed payment that caused the XXXX point drop will last on my record for 7 YEARS. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  How in the world is this 1 missed payment equal to the punishment of a missed payment? 

I finish by saying that credit is very important. You use it for everything from purchasing a home, to setting up electric/water, to buying a car. I understand there are necessary punishments, but a company who is willing to submit a missed payment to the credit bureau should at least send an email with a heads up of a missed payment before they send it. A letter is nice, but does it do anything after the fact? None the less, if I do miss a payment is 100 points the correct way of handling it? 100 points is a crippling effect that does not seem fair. I have contemplated reaching out to XXXX but figured this would be a good first step. Thank you for your help.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"To Whom It Must Concern : On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I applied and was approved for a Barclaycard Ring MasterCard. The sole purpose of me getting this credit card is because they offered me promotional 15 months of 0 % interest on any balance transfers made within the first 45 days of opening this card. My intention was to transfer {$6000.00} from my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX platinum credit card to this card and pay it off with zero interest. While doing the online application for the card, there was an option to submit a balance transfer and I did so. It was indicated by a green check mark that my balance transfer had been submitted successfully and that it would take 4-6 weeks to process. On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a letter from Barclay, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX, stating my initial balance transfer was unsuccessful. I promptly called and spoke to XXXX ( Confirmation # : XXXX ) and she assured me that she would resubmit the same balance transfer and that it would be expedited to only take 7-10 business days. Even though she was unable to give me a reason as to why the first balance transfer failed, I would have to say that she was the most helpful Barclay representative that Ive spoken with to date. I patiently waited for this balance transfer to come through my XXXX account and finally, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, my {$6000.00} balance transfer was accepted. A few days later, while making an online XXXX purchase with my XXXX checking account, XXXX informed me that debit card was invalid. I double checked the numbers and it still gave me an error. I promptly logged into my XXXX account online and was shocked to see that on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, {$6000.00} had been taken out of my XXXX credit card as a STOP PAYMENT on the Barclay balance transfer that had already been approved and accepted. This caused me to go over {$2000.00} into the negative as I had now exceeded my credit line with XXXX. This also caused a stop payment on an online purchase I had made earlier that day with my XXXX credit card, and put a freeze on my debit card and any checks coming through ( causing XXXX to not recognize the account ). I immediately called Barclay but could only be told a Manager would call me back within XXXX. Finally, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was able to speak with XXXX, who stated he was a Manager with Barclay ( Confirmation # : XXXX ). After several HmmmI dont knows, he proceeded to tell me, with lack of empathy or willingness to resolve my issue, that the second balance transfer submitted on the XXXX of XXXX had been kicked back by the 3rd party who issued the check due to an invalid account number. At this point, I got XXXX from XXXX on the line, and asked if she could verify the account number with XXXX from Barclay. The account number was correct and she confirmed that there was no mistake on my part as the customer. All of the information I had given Barclay regarding the balance transfer was correct. The three of us were on that phone call for two and a half hours and the primary reason was due to XXXX lag and sheer indifference to my situation. My dissatisfaction as a customer with Barclay Bank did not seem to matter to him one bit. Not only did he never recognize the mistake that his financial institution had made ( he blamed it on the 3rd party that had issued the check ), but he never apologized for the subsequent hardship it had caused me. In fact, when XXXX asked him to send over a fax or email confirming that the balance transfer error was not caused by me, so that she could at least unfreeze my debit card and give me access to those funds, XXXX wasnt even cooperative. I have truly never experienced anything like this. Feeling defeated and in desperate need to get my accounts back to normal, I asked him to put through a third attempt on the same balance transfer, hoping everything would eventually be resolved between my Barclay and XXXX credit accounts. He read me the required recording, I verbally accepted, and then when I asked if he could guarantee that the same error would not happen again, all he could say is that there was no way to guarantee that. Still, I was hopeful that with speaking to a Manager and having plenty of notes in my account with Barclay, this would be the last time I had to speak with anyone at Barclay about an issue. Two days later, on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I was having tapas at a local restaurant. I attempted to use my Barclay card to pay for my {$6.00} tab and my server politely advised me that my credit card had been run through twice, and twice declined. How could this be? I knew I had over {$500.00} in available funds and this is after the balance transfer had been submitted for {$6000.00}. One would typically feel embarrassed in this kind of situation but I felt relieved. I knew that this was absolutely the final straw on this Barclay account. I quickly paid my server with cash and called Barclay one last time. I was surprised to automatically be transferred to fraud protection where XXXX asked to verify my account. When I asked her why my credit card had just been declined, she told me that since my third balance transfer had not been verified, my card was put on hold. I was enraged. How could my balance transfer have not been verified when I was on the phone with a Manager for two and a half hours and he had a recording of me saying to proceed with the transfer? She said that two managers had called me the next day and I had not been able to be reached so they CANCELLED the third balance transfer. If it is Barclays policy to verify a balance transfer with a Manager call back ( which Ive absolutely never heard of ), then why did XXXX not inform me of that incoming call during our conversation? I was not under any impression that I should be waiting for a XXXX # to call me in the coming days and, like most people, I do not pick up calls from phone numbers I do not know. Just two days earlier, when I had asked XXXX if there was anything else I needed to do on my end, shouldnt he have told me that? I was a 100 % certain I had done everything right on this third balance transfer and somehow, I still failed to get my money. This is when I asked XXXX to transfer me to Barclays Cancellation Department. Up until now, having dealt with subpar professionalism, and, unenthusiastic, mediocre customer service, I was hopeful that at least the Cancellation Department would fight for me as a customer. I have good credit, I have good history with my other financial institutions, I really thought whoever I got on the line would really feel for my situation and try their best to make an effort to keep me as a customer ; to right their wrongs. I got XXXX XXXX she said her initials were : XXXX ) and much to my dismay and disappointment, it was very evident in the beginning of our call that she was not there to save customers. She seemed to be reading off of a script and after I gave her an exhausting but concise summary of what an awful experience I had had dealing with her institution, she didnt so much as let out a sigh. I believe her exact words were ok as she continued on with her script, as if nothing I said meant anything to her. There was no apology, there was no regret, there was not even an offer to make it right. Maybe I was nave to have hoped for more. It actually became comical when she restated that I would lose my promotional 45day 0 % balance transfer feature should I cancel my card, to which I replied to her that I had not received one benefit to this card and that would be quite alright.",Credit card or prepaid card

I waited the fifteen days and hadn't heard from anyone so I call the number that was given to me for claims on XXXX XXXX and was advised that the claim was closed and they were sending me a cashiers check for {$3400.00} and that was a combined check for the checking and savings account.

4. Parallel to processing the application for the loan modification CitiMortgage began foreclosure proceedings making me believe that this was a necessary process to qualify for the HAMP program. To my surprise on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I was served summons by the court. I believe this was done in purpose to pressure me to accept the loan modification that they would propose. 
5. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I received an email informing me of the approval of the mod-trial, which I accepted after the scary moment I endure when I received the summons. 
6. The mod-trial ended by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX but, on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX send me a Servicing transfer, to begin payments on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Although, the mod-trial payment ended XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, the modification agreement dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX calls for a modified principal balance as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Additionally, the amount that was previously deferred for XXXX was included in the principal also, the loan was extended 3 more years or 40 years from the closing date and 4.625 interest rate, the new monthly payment increased from XXXX to XXXX. 
8. I received the closing package on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and when I called to question why they had deceived me during 9 months making me believe that my payment could be reduced, they told me that "" if we do n't receive the package by tomorrow '' they will foreclose. They gave me no choice to deny the offer. I still have not recovered my business income and is really causing me hardship. If they had not encourage me to stop making the payment with the hope that I could get the HAMP rate I would have never applied for the second modification. My credit score has been affected. 
9. CitiMortgage did not provide me with an amortization schedule and neither a breakdown of the late charges, interest, late payments and principal that were modified. Therefore I do n't know if they waived all prior late charges as outlined in their offer.",Mortgage

I attempted to track down information for repayment around the time of my graduation ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and saw Dep of ED/ECSI Federal Perkins Loan Servicer '' listed as the servicer, but I was unable to find any account or repayment information and the website link on the studentaid.gov site went to an invalid website ( see attachments ).

My argument is that regardless of the fact that Navient REPORTED my account as current some months, I haven't made a payment in over 7 years. After the last payment I made in XX/XX/XXXX, I never came back current. I believe the purge date of this account should be based on the actual date I went delinquent and was never current again.

Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts.

Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures.

I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went to XXXX XXXX  XXXX ( Address : XXXX. XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Phone : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to fill up the car with gas ( XXXX sedan ) that we rented before returning it to XXXX. I gave my Bank of America Alaska Visa credit card to the attendant and he ran the card through his machine. He then told me it did not go through and he needed another card. I gave him a second Bank of America XXXX to try. He ran the card through his machine and then told me it did not go through either. My fiance then gave the attendant his Bank of America credit card. The attendant said this charge went through. The attendant did not provide us with any receipts. When I looked at my credit card transactions on both cards, I saw that the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America Alaska credit card in the amount of {$100.00} and the charge from XXXX to my Bank of America Mastercard in the amount of {$84.00} both posted. The charge to my fiance 's credit card in the amount of {$60.00} also posted to his credit card. When I attempted to contact XXXX, I got a message saying the party was temporarily unavailable. I filed disputes on both transactions on XX/XX/XXXX through Bank of America and provided supporting documentation. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, I received letters from Bank of America stating that they were unable to determine that a billing error occurred and they issued credits to my account for the disputed charges. The letters also stated that Bank of America was considering the dispute resolved but the merchant would have the opportunity to present new information on why the charges were valid. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Bank of America notifying me that they reviewed the details of my dispute on my Alaska Visa credit card and were unable to pursue the dispute further. My Bank of America Alaska Credit Card was then charged the original disputed amount of {$100.00}. I called Bank of America to ask why my account was charged and was told that XXXX provided signed receipts for the transactions and because it was a chipped transaction, they had to consider it valid, and I was required to pay it. I did not sign any receipts when I was at XXXX because the attendant told me his machine was not working. I requested an appeal of Bank of America 's decision but was told because the signed receipts were provided by XXXX, there was nothing I could do, even though I did not sign anything and the receipts must have been forged.

"I am disputing a derogatory credit report issued by XXXX XXXX based on two missed payments, specifically in XXXX and XX/XX/2018. 
Several phone calls were made to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018 to expedite payment and clear the remaining balance in order for this writer to appeal for reversal of the derogatory remarks with XXXX 's consumer credit specialist. This writer further went to XXXX 's store on XX/XX/XXXX and turned in a {$150.00} cash deposit to customer service to fast-pay an adjusted balance of {$140.00} since the phone payment done on XX/XX/XXXX has not cleared yet ( normally takes 48 hours per XXXX XXXX ). 

An excerpt of the letter sent to XXXX XXXX to help resolve the issue is thereby included in this narrative : I am writing to dispute a late payment report with derogatory remarks imposed in my credit file. The item Im disputing is XXXX star rewards account. Its remaining adjusted balance of {$140.00} was paid over the phone as of XX/XX/2018, and the account was closed upon my request. 
This late payment report is inaccurate because of the following : 1. I accompanied my XXXX-year-old daughter to XXXX store to pick and purchase a party dress for her. When the purchase was made on XX/XX/2018 ( original purchase {$100.00}, the record was obtained from XXXX store XXXX ), I was under the impression that the items were applied into my debit/bank card because I handed it over to the store clerk. I was offered during this check- out to enroll for XXXX rewards card for on the spot store discounts and for future purchases. I said No, I dont have enough time because we were in a hurry to leave for her hockey game that evening. The store clerk insisted it will take a few minutes so I reluctantly said okay. I preferred using my debit card as a credit card so I signed off for the purchase and we both quickly left. I was unaware that the store card was also approved during check-out and the purchase was entered into the store card instead of my debit/bank card which I thought was charged for the purchase so I did not expect a bill to arrive. 
2. I received XXXX statement as of XX/XX/2018, and found out that the account is 2 months past due. Im not even aware if there were other statements that were mailed to us because this is the first and only statement my husband and I have seen for the months of XXXX and XXXX. The address printed on this statement is incorrect. The full address is as printed above .... ( address deleted per CFPB instructions ). We live in a 16- unit condominium building with a designated mailbox for each owner. I did not receive a XXXX XX/XX/2018 statement nor a XXXX credit card. There is no guarantee that previous XXXX XXXX statements were delivered appropriately or mailed to my current address. 
As a result of this derogatory remarks sent to the credit bureaus, my credit rating was greatly impacted in the midst of our mortgage loan pre-closing which was questioned during supplemental report review. 
I am requesting for removal and reversal of the derogatory credit reporting as I find this unfair and unacceptable business practice. For a {$100.00} or unadjusted {$110.00} which I initially offered to pay for with my debit card, your store clerks should have been trained to respect preferred payment methods from customers who already said no the first time when an invitation for a store card is presented but declined.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"I became aware of an issue with my credit when I was searching for cars for my XXXX daughters. I asked my loan officer why I was paying 17.50 % on a car loan and he explained it was due to information in my credit file with Equifax. I immediately got copies from all XXXX bureaus and to my horror found much more than late payments, but different names, addresses, accounts ( department store, as well as collection accounts. It saddened me because I thought as a XXXX veteran/ former soldier i had nothing to worry about. Someone stealing my identity was the last thing on my mind. I know the accounts are not mine because I was stationed XXXX at the time. When I call and try to get information from the collection agencies as to when the accounts were originally opened I get that they were sold or bought from another company. I filed a police report, notified all XXXX bureaus, faxed in the police report and asked for a an alert to be placed on my file as well as disputed the information. Only to find out that the credit bureaus did none of this except remove the addresses and the names. they did not investigate any of the accounts, nor did they or have they to this date hold these collection agencies accountable for constantly re-aging debts on my credit file. According to the FCRA, collection agencies can not do this, nor can they keep charging you for the same debt and call it something else. Such is the case with a collection account that IS actually mine. 
there is a medical bill and XXXX bill that the VA refuses to pay even though when the XXXX driver called VA prior to leaving my home for my disposition, VA told the driver to take me to a local hospital, the drive to the VA hospital was over an hour away. I did not choose this hospital, the VA directed this as well as I did not choose to get sick and need an ambulance, it was due to my service XXXX.because VA refused to pay this bill it immediately went to a collection agency even though I appealed it. 
The next thing that I have an issue with is that I have been with my credit union for over 20 years and after finding out about the incorrect information in my file from Equifax , It was with the other bureaus as well. I knew that the XXXX times they reported me late for car loan payments were not true because I had all accounts set up on allotments. It was always easier for me that way. Now that I am a veteran I still have my check direct deposited and my accounts are drafted out of money before anything hits my checking account. My loan officer does n't seem to understand how the credit bureaus are reporting me late when Im not. The only thing Im being told is "" were sorry there is nothing we can do '' after the first dispute was filed, I had to file over XXXX, my credit bureau verified that I have never been late on any loan or account with them. now once again this erroneous information is BACK on my file and no one wants to fix it. I was told if it ends up back in my file then the credit bureaus made the mistake, not my credit union. but the credit bureaus will not fix their mistake. As a result of their incorrect and outdated credit reporting I have suffered the following damages : denied credit, denied housing, denied employment, charged higher interest rates on loans when I could have paid a lower interest rate if correct information was in my file. the biggest thing that hurts me today. As a XXXX veteran, I ca n't even use my VA certificate to purchase a home for myself, because of someone else 's mistakes. The credit bureaus have no idea how their ignorance and down right refusal to take a closer look have impacted my life. I have considered closing my account with the credit union because there has to be another answer than "" well its not our fault '' ... '' it must be theirs ''. I have done everything in my power, which is to pay my bills on time.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"REQUEST FOR FREE ANNUAL CREDIT REPORT!!! 
I believe that each consumer reporting agency has invalidated the true spirit of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. The Act first established XX/XX/2003 was intended to establish a plan whereas common American citizens could obtain a copy of their credit reports at least once a year free of charge. Since each credit reporting agency now has marketing divisions such as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXXXXXX, the automation system to obtain the free annual reports is looped into an information request to steer citizens into additional product offers that are excessive and unnecessary. Even though I may have received an approval of an updated credit report from either XXXX, Trans Union or XXXX respectively, it is unfair that I need to do a mail request since I can submit my personal information through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) portal. I believe that since the CFPB is the sole responsible oversight party of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, its imperative that any additional solicitation of information from the credit bureaus should be blocked permanently. I along with any other citizen should receive a free credit report upon request. The credit reporting agencies are an important aspect of the national banking system to properly function, but the current aggressive marketing campaign soliciting citizens for an arbitrary FICO score has gone too far, including but not limited to XXXX XXXXXXXX. We must return to a common ground that is fair for all consumers in the United States, and we must be able to request additional marketing on our own terms.

"I contacted CFPB on XX/XX/XXXX to report that inXX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America ( BOA ) denied my request for an increase in my credit limit on my Bank of America credit card.

My credit is current and well-managed. I disagree with BOA 's assessment of my credit utilization, but there appears to be little that I can do about this issue.

"Please see letter written to Synchrony Bank, which provides all details of the dispute. 

XX/XX/2019 Synchrony Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, Utah XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX : I am writing to you about a CARE CREDIT card I have with you. I have had numerous conversations with your customer service team in regard to a deferred interest issue and we have been unable to remediate the issue. 

There have been numerous issues I have had throughout my time doing business with your company. Communication on your end has consistently been deceptive and unfair ; terms were not properly conveyed, and promises were made that were never kept. 

When originally opening the card, it was presented as an easy way to pay medical bills that were unaffordable to me at the time. I am a senior and unfortunately, I was unable to pay large medicals bills in one bulk payment. As it was presented, your card seemed like a logical answer to my problem. I was advised if I paid a set agreed upon amount a month I would pay my balance off and not be charged any interest. Again, this was appealing to me as I do not have the income to pay excessive interest on top of the high medical bill ( s ). After opening the card, I made payments religiously and assumed my balance would payoff over the time set without any interest charges. 
In XX/XX/2019, I received a bill showing I was charged an excessive amount of interest and I immediately called your customer service department to see what had happened. After speaking to a representative from Synchrony, I found out it was due to deferred interest charges. I explained the issue or misunderstanding in terms to the representative and she advised that she understood and that I could just pay off the principal balance and she would waive the deferred interest charged. She advised that this transaction would pay my balance in full. At this time, I paid the amount she stated was due ( {$360.00} ), and assumed the account was closed as paid in full as agreed. 
The following month, I received a statement showing I still had a balance and I immediately called your customer service department. I was advised that the previous agent misspoke, and you would not be waiving any charges. I have called numerous times after this conversation and I been advised by management that nothing could be done. At this time, due to deferred interest, my balance is at {$920.00}, which is more than I originally borrowed. 

Your practices have continued to be deceptive and misleading. I expect a company to properly convey the terms of the agreement and stand by what their representatives say and/or promise. Neither of these actions have been shown. 
The CFPB has completed numerous studies showing many deferred-interest products lack transparency, which causes many consumers to not fully understand how deferred interest promotions operate and the manner in which interest is assessed on these products. A lack of transparency can harm consumers by impeding their ability to manage their finances successfully. The potential for confusion only increases if these accounts are used for other purchases as well. 

Your companies lack of transparency has been extremely harmful to me and has caused a great financial burden and great deal of stress. I believe your CARE CREDIT product preys on the elderly in their time of need ( medical issues ) and your goal is to confuse people in a very vulnerable state. 

At this time, I have decided to pay the minimum on the card until this issue is resolved, as my credit is being affected. As part of the resolution, I expect my credit to be corrected to show me as current and paid in full, with no delinquencies present. I now have delinquencies shown which is also hurting my ability to move into a senior living community. 

Complaints have also been logged with the CFPB and FTC. 

Please let me know how we can rectify this issue in a quick manner.

"Approximately six months ago, citi requested that I change the email on my credit card accounts. I asked them to make sure that the email got changed correctly on all of my citi accounts and they assured me it would be. This was important because I only receive email statements and not mailed statements. However, citi failed to change the email on one of my accounts. After that, I no longer received email statements for that account and the account no longer showed up on my online account. Because I was not receiving statements and it did n't appear on my online account, I was unaware that an annual fee had hit and I owed money. After I missed a payment, citi began calling me. I returned their call and asked them to go through each of my accounts with me and ensure they were all fully paid and in good standing. We spent approximately fourty-five minutes on the phone and went through each of the accounts they had on record for me. They assured me all of my accounts were in good standing. However, I continued to receive calls from Citi. When I picked up the phone, they said I had an account past due. This was despite the fact that I had just called citi and they had assured me all my accounts were in good standing. Apparently, even Citi had failed to locate this account. Because this account was over thirty days past due, Citi reported the late payment to the credit bureaus. However, the late payment was due solely to Citi 's forcing me to change my email address ( thereby making me reset my online account ), Citi 's failure to change the email on this account despite assuring me they had, and their failure to locate my account when I called specifically to ask about it.

I received a call from State Home Mortgage on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX at approx XXXX EST asking me when do I plan on making payment. I felt that this number one was very unprofessional versus asking me what is going on or if I was aware that they had not received payment. I then explained to the representative that I made my payment via online Bill pay through my financial institution on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that the payment was taken out of my checking account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.

I mailed 8 years of proof of payment which included the attached documents along with my personal bank account statements which showed these payments were made to Citi Student Loan and their Creditors they sold the loans over the years.

I am yet to hear directly from Citi Student Loans on the proof of payments I have submitted to them and a reconciliation of the loans I paid off. They can not show any proof with the payment I made and how they were applied to the loan and why they continue to show a balance on the Student Loan accounts and reporting the account as charge off collection.

"There are a couple of reasons why I am filing this complaint : 1 ) I have not received results from my 3rd round disputes from Equifax and 2 ) Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX all claiming that unverified, invalidated accounts are "" reporting correctly '', "" mine '', "" valid '', and "" verified ''. First, regarding Equifax, it has to now be WELL over 45 days that I have not heard back from them. All of a sudden, around XX/XX/XXXX I noticed that I started getting automated emails from them instead of paper communication via postal mail. I never requested to start getting email confirmations because I wanted hard copies of everything. To top things off, the emails didn't even work! The link would take me to their site to enter my personal info in and a confirmation number, but the following page would give me an error. This was partly due to the fact that the emails would be sent one day AFTER the expiration dates and then supposedly give a short timeframe to view the results! It was completely absurd. They basically made sure that I was funneled into their extremely flawed system. I know this to be a fact of their system being flawed ; I called at least twice to ask about the status of my 3rd round results and was told each time from reps that there was a glitch in their system. I managed to get thru the system to provide a screenshot of failed dispute results and a false claim atop the list saying the results were mailed. I asked repeatedly for my results to be MAILED to me and I was assured that I would be receiving them in the mail. Weeks later and still no results. It is my understanding that when this happens, the bureau is absolutely required to delete all accounts that are requested to be deleted. That leads me to the next issue : my disputes. Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX  have all repeatedly come back claiming that the disputed accounts are "" verified '' as "" accurate '' and "" validated '' WITHOUT PROVIDING JUST CAUSE FOR REPORTING THIS, that of course being valid proof. Under the FCRA, they are supposed to validate these accounts with original consumer contracts bearing my wet signature. They have not done that -- and remember, it has been MONTHS of them doing this. Does the government advocate a company like Equifax, XXXX, and XXXX allowing information to be placed in consumer credit reports without proof, verification, and validation from the reporting sources?? This is negligent of them all and very dangerous to my identity as a consumer! I have told them all this repeatedly. XXXX  in particular has written back recently stating their refusal to reinvestigate the disputed accounts ( unless I provide extra proof of something ). Seriously?? YOU the COMPANY are subject to ME as a CONSUMER and to the LAW, which you all have dismissed. I even called XXXX and was told this by a rep, claiming they are not required to provide proof. Um, this is NOT what the FCRA and FDCPA states. Furthermore, what sense does it make to not verify the validity of an account? This is precisely how scammers get away with their crimes. If an account does not provide verified proof of an account 's validity with an original consumer contract, then the account MUST BE DELETED. There have also been other discrepancies with accounts that I've brought to their attention, but they have fallen on deaf ears. I have included a copy of the 3 letters that I have sent to Equifax to remind them of the accounts I have been and those I still am disputing. I have included a copy of the 4 letters I sent to Equifax. Lastly, I have included the 4 letters I sent to XXXX ; as of the date of this complaint submission, I haven't heard back from my 4th dispute with them. Some of these files have been redacted for size and added to a separate document. By the way, there is an account that I have made note of in an additional document that was unverified and outright deleted from Equifax months ago, stopped reporting on XXXX  during that same time and onward for about 2 months, yet recently made an appearance BACK on XXXX.

"Hi, I am writing this letter/notice of complaint because I feel that there are companies and agencies that are falsely impersonating U.S. Government agencies and personnel and as a result are and have fraudulently taken advantage of U.S. citizens such as myself. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was on the world wide web just browsing when I saw a Student Loan Relief Program ad and it was mentioning having a program that could assist people with consolidating and possibly eliminating Student Loan debt. The ad had some sort of XXXX number to call to inquire and see if you could qualify. Being I was suffering tremendously XXXX from coping with medical and student loan debt along with other problems, I was extremely curious to learn and discover if I could get any relief with my student loan debt so I called the number the ad listed and spoke to a gentleman whom said his name was XXXX XXXX. Over the course of about 30 mins, XXXX XXXX had asked me all sorts of questions such as my date of birth, social security number, income information, company and field information, household size and more. 
XXXX told me that based off my income and occupation of working for an agency that services the general public, I met the qualifications for the Student Loan Relief Program. He told me that to sign up for and to take advantage of the program, he would have to run a credit check on me to see if the program would finance me for what they called a service fee for the program but said that all I would have to pay would be {$39.00} a month for 2 years and gave the notion and promise that my student loans would be eliminated. XXXX then said that he would need to send me some documents via email for me to sign along with me sending copies of my paystubs for the past 30 days and I did so. 
When the email came to my email inbox, I noticed that it was from a two other and separate entities ( companies ) but all documents pointed one another back to the Student Loan Relief Department which to my ignorance and understanding was all the Federal Government. These two companies were the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and Equitable Acceptance Corporation. Per Equitable Acceptance, they were the company to run my credit for a request authorization and added and opened a line of credit in my name and account for the {$1300.00} that they stated they paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to finance me for the program for services. Please note and be advised that to this very day, I have never been able to speak to anyone at XXXX XXXX XXXX to inquire about my case and account. Equitable Acceptance Corporation, however, are the company and agency whom are to this present day of XX/XX/XXXX, are auto debiting {$39.00} from my checking account. 
Over the course of 2 years, I have called Equitable Acceptance to inquire about the validity and justification of their program and all I get is a bounce around and shift of responsibility back to XXXX XXXX XXXX and the Student Loan Relied Department. Then about a year ago or maybe more, I began to receive emails from a company called XXXX XXXX whom Equitable Acceptance has added to yet another 3rd party ordeal. Representatives from Equitable Acceptance say that they hired XXXX XXXX to come in and handle the document preps for customers whom when recertifications are due. Once introduced to XXXX XXXX about a year ago, that is when I started getting a gut feeling that something was not right and began to feel that my identity, banking information and more was compromised and that I being taken advantage of so I immediately called into the Federal Student Loan contact line to inquire about my loan status. I was then brought to the awareness that what Equitable Acceptance and XXXX XXXX were doing was simply and solely placing my student loan accounts and payments on a deferment plan. My student loan debt amounts have not decreased at all and are very much still present. 
Just yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I called Equitable Acceptance Corporation to inquire about the length of time I had left before they would seize from auto-debiting my bank account and was told I still had over 18 months left to pay the {$39.00}. I then became utterly and extremely perplexed about what exactly it was that this company was actually doing for me versus to me so I asked for justification and proof and was told I would be mailed the documents showing and proving that Equitable Acceptance did indeed pay XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a total of {$1300.00} however I have learned that in situations like this, there is and will never be an actual file that would be provided to me to prove that Equitable Acceptance paid that amount of money on my behalf and are rightly justified in them debiting funds from me. All the while, I would be paying them nearly 5 years and would still have the student loan debt that I began with only the amounts will increase due to the forbearance and interests. 
Since having all these gut feelings and proof that someone is taking advantage of me by way of government fraud, I have searched the web and the Better Business Bureau to look up information and complaints against the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Equitable Acceptance Corporation and to my surprise many others have the same story as I do and feel compromised and scammed.",Debt collection

"InXX/XX/2019, my previous apartment complex forwarded a balance to National Credit Systems after ignoring my attempts to resolve the issue ahead of time. On the first phone call between myself and National Credit Systems ( XX/XX/2019 ), I informed the agent that the terms set in the lease for charging and collecting balances after move out had been violated, and we had made multiple attempts to discuss the matter directly with the apartment complex. The agent told us that essentially the legality of the debt owed is not their concern, and any legal action we take against the apartments for improper collection of debt is out of their hands and will not prevent them from reporting the unpaid debt and harming our credit if the balance is not paid. I also informed the agent that I had proof of payment of the portion of the balance they had in collection that had previously been paid, and inquired what proof was necessary to have this removed from the balance. Agent stated this could not be removed unless the apartments verified receipt of payment. Informed the agent at National Credit Systems that payment had been sent via certified mail by traceable money order, and I could provide proof at any time. At this time, the agent promised to provide us with written notification of the debt owed by email ; this e-mail was never sent out. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called National Credit Systems again to request the written notification of debt owed, and finally received an email. Agent informed me that she would open a 30 day dispute process during which National Credit systems would attempt to clarify any discrepancies on balances owed and look in to the claims made during the original phone call. Agent reminded us again that if we choose to wait for the apartment complex to respond, this situation will negatively impact our credit report once National Credit Systems changes our accounts status to default. Agent made it clear that even if we don't owe the money, we will need to set up a payment plan of some kind with National Credit Systems to keep them from putting our account in default status and negatively impacting our credit. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called National Credit systems to confirm they had received the proof of payment, asking again if this portion of the balance had been removed from the balance held in collections. The agent confirmed this proof had been added to our file. However, the balance owed to National Credit Systems was not adjusted. I was also informed by the agent that our previous apartment complex had not responded to any request for clarification, the dispute window would be closed, and to avoid having the account status placed in default and reported negatively to our credit, we would need to set up a payment plan regardless of the questionable legality of the debt sent to collections. The agent offered me a "" settlement '' in the amount of {$430.00}, I believe. According to the agent, if paid immediately, our account would be considered closed and nothing would be reported to the credit bureaus. I can not confirm this amount exactly, because the agent promised to send information by email, then later said on XX/XX/XXXX it is against management 's policy to send any information in paper or email format regarding settlement amounts offered to close the account. The agent still avoided my question about removing the balance not owed, and instead told me that the settlement offered encompasses a larger deduction than the amount made, making it sound like some kind of deal I should consider taking. 

During the XX/XX/XXXX called, I again informed National Credit Systems that I planned to file a case with the county against the apartments, and the agent stated that this was "" our word against theirs '', offered me another settlement that was a slightly lower dollar amount than the previous one mentioned, and told me that if I choose not to take the settlement or wait for the outcome of the legal case, on XX/XX/XXXX, National Credit Systems planned to move forward in changing the account status to delinquent and negatively impacting our credit. 

There is an open court case in our county of residence regarding the legality of the charges our previous apartment claims that we ( my husband and I ) owe them, and this has also been communicated to National Credit Systems as recently as XX/XX/XXXX. I called National Credit Systems and asked to speak to a supervisor to inquire why the balance had not been adjusted and again inform the agency that a court case had been filed against their client who had turned the balance over to them. As of XX/XX/XXXX, none of the balance has been adjusted, including the portion I have proven we have paid although proof of payment has been mailed directly to National Credit Systems. 

I have also mailed them a letter by certified mail, which included a copy of the small claims court case for breach of contract, requesting that they postpone changing our account status to default until after we have reached a resolution between myself and their client regarding whether or not the balance turned over to collections now. 

As it stands, our only remaining option is to open a payment plan account with National Credit systems and begin making payments on a balance that is in collections that we do not feel we owe since nothing we have said has convinced them to postpone changing the status of our account.",Debt collection

"To whom it may concern, I am having some troubling issues with my mortgage company, Home Point Financial, in which I feel I have been taken. There are two complaints with this same company. 
The first I will address is that the lender has charged me five months of interest that the mortgage company had absolutely no right to collect. Ten months after I purchased my home with a mortgage from HomePoint Financial, my home was a complete loss, along with everything I own, to the East Troublesome Fire on XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage received {$190000.00} including a letter for instruction to pay toward the principal on or around XXXX XXXX, of XXXX, which was the initial 50 % of the insurance proceeds on the house from XXXX XXXX. The initial check from XXXX XXXX did not satisfy the full loan balance and XXXX XXXX had refused to take the 50 %. The loan balance was @ {$380000.00}. However, the mortgage agreement specifically allows and states that any principal amounts can be prepaid without penalty. When I called them to get the check applied to the mortgage, ( sometime in early XXXX XXXX the mortgage company lied stating that they had not cashed the check. XXXX XXXX confirmed that the check was cashed on XX/XX/XXXX. As a result of not applying the insurance proceeds to the loan, I have incurred 5 months of interest that should not have been owed, if the check had been applied to the mortgage. As XXXX refused to apply the funds for months and months, so I had to hire an attorney to get XXXX to do what the mortgage agreement clearly spelled out that they had to do. XXXX XXXX had finally applied the 50 % 5 months after the initial attempt of the payment. 
I would respectfully ask that the 5 months of interest that should not have been invoiced by reimbursed. I would also ask that my attorney fees of {$3300.00} be covered. 

The second issue is part of my homeowners insurance that XXXX XXXX is also taking me for. As stated earlier, my home had burned down on XX/XX/XXXX. The day after the fire, I made a claim with my insurance company and had also cancelled my homeowners ' insurance, as it was a total loss and there was nothing to cover. I had then, in early XXXX of XXXX, received a letter from Home Point financial Stating that they needed to receive insurance information for the property and that XXXX XXXX will be purchasing insurance at my expense. I had immediately called Home Point Financial upon receiving this letter, and spoke with a person named XXXX XXXX. He had cleared up this particular issue and assured me that the insurance would once again be cancelled. 
XX/XX/XXXX I was charged {$3600.00} for homeowners ' insurance that XXXX XXXX had purchased at my expense. I spoke with HomePoint again recently, XX/XX/XXXX, to try and get to the bottom of this. I was then told by XXXX that I would get a refund for this money if I had liability insurance. This is something I was certainly not aware of this entire time, otherwise I would have purchased liability insurance the day after the fire. Although, upon further research, I have learned that my renter 's insurance has liability insurance that covers any properties that I own, which I have had since XXXX of XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with Home Point Financial again and showed them my renters ' policy with the liability insurance. I was then told by XXXX XXXX that this was not what they were looking for and that they needed to look in to it and get back with me in XXXX XXXX. The problem here is, I do not believe them. They have lied to me before and I believe they will again. I have not had any sort of response as of today, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX well over XXXX XXXX  ) I feel that Home Point Financial needs do the right thing and I want HomePoint to refund the premiums that they wrongly charged me.

Also we keep being told we can submit my own insurance but when the Insurance company calls to get info from Bank of Oklahoma they are told that the property is in foreclosure and they can not place new insurance on my property in foreclosure.

"On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened an estate account at Chase Bank following my mother 's passing. One week prior to my appointment to open the account, I was required to bring in all of the required legal papers such as my letters testamentary and the estate EIN. I was told the paperwork passed muster and I was allowed to open the account. A week later I received a letter telling me that I needed to supply further identifying information. I called the 877 number provided but after an hour on hold, I gave up and reached out to the branch for resolution instead. ( This was another option provided in the letter. ) A day later, on XX/XX/2021, the banker reached back out and told me the issue had been resolved. Specifically, he relayed that the branch had scanned the documents a few days after the account was opened and the timing created an issue. I was told the documents had been scanned in by the branch and that I did not need to worry about the issue. I was therefore quite surprised a month later when I received a cashier 's check for the amount of funds belonging to the estate with a notice that my account had been closed. I reached out to the branch and was told they would look into the matter. I also again attempted to call the 877 number. This time I was on hold for XXXX hours at which point the system hung up on me. I discussed this matter over the next few days with branch personnel and was just told that they could not open the account because I live in a state other than my mother 's state of residence which has jurisdiction over the probate. This is a particularly strange reason given that I had just concluded my step-father 's estate that was held in the same jurisdiction one month prior to opening my mother 's estate account. The Bank is under the mistaken impression that the state of probate does not allow the estate account to be held in another state. However, my probate attorney told me it was ok and the court in the case of my step-father had no concerns about my opening the account in another state. 

At this point, I am left with a check for over {$200000.00} that is no longer earning interest. This puts me in the extremely awkward position of not being able to fulfill my fiduciary duty as executor. Chase Bank has been deceptive with me, making false statements with material impact, in that they had numerous opportunities to tell me if they had concerns about opening the account. For example, why tell me they needed identifying information when no additional information could cure what they see as a problem. If they had been forthright, I could have transferred the funds to another bank during the waiting period and continued to earn interest. It also strikes me as unfair in that their back office operations caused me injury that I could not have avoided and it is not outweighed by any benefits.

"Greetings, I have frequent and distressing problems with my loan company, MOHELA. My current problem is that they revoked my deferment ; while confusing ( I was under the impression from them that my XXXX enrollment was sufficient through XX/XX/XXXX! ), they also did so after a barrage of bizarre messages that appeared to change my loan terms from when they was instituted ( e.g., XX/XX/XXXX -- these were consolidated loans ), then notified me that a standard payment was due with less than 10 days warning. 

Further, they have ( and still do ) present me with conflicting information. I managed to get that first payment in by XX/XX/XXXX ( {$260.00} ), in fear of getting a 'late payment ' tag, but they were also telling me at the same time that a payment of a different amount ( {$270.00} ) was *first* due on XX/XX/XXXX. There is still conflicting information on their website -- it both tells me that a payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX ( {$270.00} ) and that no payment is due. Interest is accruing, however. 

Finally, I received no official explanation for the change in terms, nor why they instantaneously increased my Current Principal to {$21000.00} from {$20000.00} ( an increase, without explanation or warning, of {$400.00} ).

"This is a follow up complaint to a prior one filed last month where I expressed concern that Wells Fargo was intentionally delaying my modification, repeatedly asking for documentation previously sent claiming it was not received and not returning calls. The worst has happened. 

I have actively been working with an individual by the name of XXXX XXXX ( "" Home Preservation Specialist '' ) who I have been in routine contact with ( and often hard to reach ) who reassured me on a three-way phone call with an underwriter everything has been received and being processed last month. He even told my son on a separate private call the same thing the very last week of XXXX. 

This month I received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/17 stating my loan modification has been closed due to lack of documentation. How?! This could not be. No notification was ever sent that something else was missing and I was just on the phone being told my loan is being processed and all is good. I was also informed by XXXX XXXX, an "" Executive Mortgage Specialist, '' who my internal complaint was escalated to that the bank is "" looking for the best modification '' for me at the time. ALL LAST MONTH. 

After receiving the letter last weekend, my son immediately sent an email to Wells Fargo Mortgage "" Executive Office '' again where a woman named XXXX XXXX is now supposedly looking into this with a resolution dated XXXX/XXXX/17. 

But in the midst of this, a man came by my home the other day inquiring about my house being foreclosed on to my surprise. I immediately informed my son who went online and saw that Wells Fargo sent a Notice of Default to my county in XXXX unbeknownst to me, and while I was in the middle of this modification, which is the beginning of foreclosing proceeding - a PRIME CASE OF DUAL TRACKING and intentional deception. 

Unfortunately Wells Fargo can not be trusted and this needs to be escalated outside of the bank ASAP.

The deceiving, lying, unethical and perhaps illegal practices have left such a level uncertainty about where I will lay my head. I have been sending paperwork after paperwork for A YEAR.

"My loans were consolidated into two payment groups A and B and are combined for monthly payment purposes. In additional to my monthly payment I have been making principal payments to loan group A and not advancing the due date. Nelnet recently recalculated my monthly payment to a lower amount. I did not request that the account be reviewed or adjusted, and I had not paid off any of the loan groups to warrant a reduction in the payment. The only benefit of Nelnet doing this would be to ensure that they maximize the interest payments made on the loan. If I were to start making these lower monthly payments, then the term of the loan ( in months ) would remain the same and Nelnet profits from the full interest paid. I realize that I can pay the difference in a manual payment per month but I have an issue with the continually dishonest practices of this company.

"I am writing you to request help to remove foreclosure from my credit score on all XXXX along with any negative comments. The reasons are as follows : 1. I was notified that I was included in a Class Action Suit against Wells Fargo Mortgage XXXX XXXX for an illegal mortgage. 
2. Wells Fargo knew I had an illegal mortgage from XXXX. Wells Fargo agreed and signed in Federal Court to modify all the mortgages that were included in the class action suit. 
3. I spent the next year trying to talk to them. I have names, times and dates if needed. 
4. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX who asked "" Why I never applied for a modification? '' I tried numerous times and was turned away repeatedly. I did finally get them to accept the application which apparently was not processed in a timely manner since XXXX XXXX had no record of it. 
5. At this point under the advice of my attorney, I stopped paying my mortgage, in hopes we would have an open honest conversation concerning correcting or modifying my mortgage. I did not write the mortgage agreement. The Bank wrote the mortgage agreement. It was their correction to make, not mine. 
6. I am enclosing a copy of a certified letter that states I am included in the class action suit. I am also enclosing a copy of the court record dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX It states that Wells Fargo was denied the right to foreclose on me. 
7. XXXX XXXX, my husband and I agreed to sell our house. We gave up, the stress was unbearable. 
8. On XXXX of XXXX, we closed on the sale of our home with a profit, not in foreclosure or in a short sale. Wells Fargo was paid in full. 
Wells Fargo 's lawyers and my lawyers were in contact with each other the whole time. 
They have ruined my credit. We were unable to buy or rent adequate and appropriate housing after selling our home. Five years Wells Fargo played games with apparently no intention of honoring their signed agreement in Federal Court to modify and correct the illegal mortgages. 
After 40 years making timely payments to mortgage banks, this has ruined my credit and reputation. I feel they have slandered my name and implied that I am not reliable. This has caused unbelievable financial damage and hardship to our family. 
I hope by sending you documented proof and informing you of the history, that you will be able to accomplish something that I could not.

"How is it possible that an account that was supposed to have been settled with XXXX XXXX XXXX almost three years ago is now appearing on my credit report in collection with a derogatory remark. I consolidated all of my outstanding debt almost three years ago, and have not had anything negative on my credit report since. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX settled my XXXX credit card account again, almost three years ago. I have not received anything regarding an outstanding balance or owed amount since it was settled. 
Recently I applied for lower rent apartment and was denied due to a derogatory remark on my credit report. I had no idea what this could have been. 

I looked up my credit history and it reads that a XXXX account was opened XX/XX/2020, and the owed amount is XXXX I never reopened this account, and did not charge this amount of money. 

Apparently another company Lvnv took over XXXX, and does not have record of my closed account from three years ago. Regardless, I never charged XXXX, never reopened this account, nor have never received any notification that I owed anything because as far as I knew this account was closed and settled. 

I called LVN ( XXXX ) to try to get this corrected, but there was no resolution and they are saying I owe {$4300.00} which is an amount I never charged. I didn't even have a credit limit for this amount from over three years ago. My credit report is reading that I opened this account XXXX XXXX and have not paid in 8 months - this is absolutely not true. 

I can not understand how I finally got out of debt and have been building up my credit for almost three years, then this appears on my credit report from Lvnv company. How is this legal. This company prevented me from moving into an affordable apartment with my son. This one company destroyed my credit - how can this be acceptable. I am a single mom who pays my bills and takes care of my son. What gives this company the right to be able to apply this to my credit report??? Even if by chance the debt consolidator did not settle this once account, shouldn't I have received a bill, notice from XXXX???? I never once received any notification so how is it possible this company is allowed to destroy my credit in a split second when I have spent three years building it up. With COVID and all the negative in this world, I actually had one positive - a potential affordable home, but because Lvnv added an account as opened XXXX XXXX stating has not been paid in 8 months I lost my opportunity. Again, I never opened this account XXXX XXXX, nor have I ever owed this amount of money. At this point I do not know if I need to take legal action for ruining my credit, illegal allegations, lost opportunity for a secure home, mental stress, now anxiety.

On XX/XX/2021, I received an email from Monterey Financial Services, LLC, stating that my account had been transferred to them from XXXX XXXX XXXX for servicing. They instructed me to register my account with them online, because that is where I would be able to view my statements and make payments, so I did. I was given an account number. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received a text message stating that my account was now being serviced by Monterey Financial Services LLC ( Monterey ). 
On XX/XX/2021, I received a phone call from a representative of Monterey, stating that my payment was due. I logged in to make a payment for the {$37.00} that was due, and paid {$38.00}. I have had my checking account hacked twice, so I stopped using it to pay bills online and would simply transfer enough funds to my XXXX  card to cover the cost of whatever I was paying. I made sure I had {$40.00} available to cover the payment. I received an email receipt from Monterey for the payment of {$38.00}, that stated the payment would not debit my account until two days later. However, on XX/XX/2021, I received an alert from XXXX that a payment of {$48.00}, not {$38.00}, was returned due to insufficient funds. 
I immediately called Monterey to find out why they charged me {$48.00}. I spoke with someone that said her name was XXXX. She told me that there was a {$10.00} service fee to pay my bill online. I let her know that I was not aware of that fee and my receipt did not state that they were taking {$48.00}. I asked her if there was going to be a penalty for the return and she said there was a {$25.00} fee for the {$48.00} being returned and that it stated on the site that the fee would be charged. I told her I didnt notice that statement. I then asked her if it was possible for me to have the fee waived, because I did not see the statement about the fee and that my receipt said my card would be charged {$38.00}, which is the amount I made sure was available. She said I would need to forward the email that showed {$38.00} instead of {$48.00} and she would call me back after reviewing it. I sent the email, but never heard back from her. 
On XX/XX/2021, I received a call from XXXX, who said he was with Monterey and was calling about the payment. I told him that XXXX never called me back. I explained the situation to him and told him that I never received a receipt showing that the {$10.00} fee was being taken out. I also expressed to him that I felt the {$10.00} fee being charged was exorbitant. He told me that I would have to put my payments on automatic debit in order to not have the fee charged. I then asked him if he could waive the {$25.00} fee. He said he couldnt so I asked to speak with a supervisor, and he transferred my call. 
I explained the situation to the supervisor, XXXX and, again, requested a waiver of the {$25.00} fee. She refused. I also told her that my receipt did not indicate that there was a {$10.00} fee being charged and I thought that the fee was way too high. I also told her that I didnt think it was legal for them to charge me a fee and not supply me with a receipt for it. She said I needed to put my account on automatic debit to avoid it. I told her I didnt think that was fair and asked for the receipt. She said she would speak to the tech department about it, but I needed to pay the {$48.00} plus the {$25.00} returned check fee. I told her that the funds were there and she could take the payment. She then asked me if I was going to sign up for automatic debit with her and I said no. She then processed the payment. I never received a receipt for the payment. 
On XX/XX/2021, I checked my XXXX account and it showed that {$77.00} had been deducted from my account by Monterey. {$48.00} plus {$25.00} should have only been {$73.00}. They had taken an extra {$4.00}. I attempted to login to my account to see if it showed what the extra amount was for. I was not able to login. I tried using forgot password and got the message that no account existed with my account number. I tried to register again, and got a message that stated my account was not allowed to be registered. I also checked my credit report and it had dropped 40 points! The reason given for the drop in score was that Monterey had REMOVED the account from my credit report. I then called Monterey.

The first representative that I spoke with identified herself as, XXXX. I told her that I couldnt login. She said she saw my account and transferred me to their loan servicing department. 
In that department, a representative named XXXX assisted me. I asked her why the account was removed from my credit report. She said that they stopped reporting it to XXXX  and it looked like my account had been paid off. I told her that it wasnt paid off. She put me on hold and then came back to the phone. She said that she had just been told that my account had been closed by mistake, and it would be corrected shortly. She stayed on the phone with me while I attempted to login. I was finally able to login, but when I went to check my payment history, I got a message stating that my account was closed. She said that it may take a few more minutes on my end for things to be corrected, and to try again. It still didnt work. She then told me that my account had been sent back to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I asked her why. She said that it stated in the notes that they requested it ( I do not believe that anyone at XXXX XXXX XXXX made that request ). We hung up. 
I then logged into my account at XXXX, only to find that there was no way to view my payment history, make a payment, email them or call. I now have no way of making payment correctly nor able to manage my account. 
At this point, I am completely fed up. It appears that XXXX decided to retaliate against me, the consumer, because I demanded a receipt and told her I thought it was illegal for them to not provide one to me. I believe that she has, purposely, damaged my credit, denied me access to my payment history and denied me the ability to make my payments on my account ( something that I think XXXX is fully aware of ) and it will damage my credit further if payment isnt made ; all of this because I dared to demand a receipt and not sign up with their automatic debit program.

I got XXXX of their XXXX Florida Call Center ( XXXX ). She presented herself as the Supervisor.

When asking what a valid phone number meant to them and letting them know that this phone works fine ( thats the phone number Im actually using ), they were not able to explain further. When asking what the criteria was for providing a working phone number, they were unable to say. 

When I asked if I could provide another number to receive the verification code, she said no. Again, like the previous person, she said I would have to wait 24 hours or walk into a branch.

I told her I no longer cared about online banking or doing business at all with Suntrust since Suntrust is not allowing me to access my account. I would officially like to now close the account. Please send mail me a check for the full amount. 

She said that was ok, where would you like the check to be mailed. I gave her my present address in New York, but just before I finished, she cut me off and said that, Unfortunately, we will be unable to close your account. I asked why and she said, Because the phone number given did not pass the verification test. 

I then asked to speak to the manager. I was connected to XXXX XXXX, the Client Solution Supervisor of the Client First Solutions ( CFS ) Management Office. 

XXXX said, "" Unfortunately, because you didnt provide a phone number that can send and receive texts, we can not shut down your account. 

Assuming the issue is really about identification rather then a phone number that can provide texts, I asked if there was any other information she needed to verify that this is my account. She said, No. I asked to speak to someone higher than her. 

She left me on hold, then came back and told me that she had spoken with her boss, XXXX XXXX the Client First Solutions Manager of XXXX, TN, CFS Management Office. Although he was obviously there and able to speak to XXXX XXXX, she claimed that, He was unable to come to the phone right now. She then tried to give me two address which to file a complaint. I told her I had no interest in filing a complaint, I simply wanted to close my account ( I noticed that the addresses where in house addresses with Suntrust ). Asking again why I could not simply close down my account, she could provide no reason. 

Suntrust is going through a big {$66.00} billion merger at the moment, so it is in their interest to keep their accounts open. They are also going through a shareholders lawsuit based on this merger ( see XXXX  ). 

In addition, I had noticed that money was being withdrawn from my checking account numerous times at the rate of {$10.00} per Statement Period, giving no explaining what-so-ever. They only refunded the money when I discovered this withdrawl and called to make inquires. There have also been numerous complaints about this Suntrust practice. 

As a result of these actions by Suntrust, I have been denied access to my account, denied access to the funds in my account, and can no longer even check my account to see if theyre continuing withdrawing money from it. Even more shocking, I can not even close my account.","Bank account or service, Savings account"

2. The date you contacted the furnisher of information ( current in relation to this letter ).

She told me to call Nova/Greystar and get something in writing and my response was that I have been disputing this for over 14 months now and they will not give me anything in writing. 

She told me to call back in 1 week to check on their status. I know they will continue to try and collect and report it as not disputed. I have worked very hard to keep my credit clean and a good credit score. This has caused my financial harm. I do not owe this money. 

I am furious that this has already been reported to my credit report, being disputed or not, it is not fair and I do now owe this money. 


Letter sent disputing the debt : To : XXXX XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WA XXXX XXXX RE : account # XXXX from original creditor XXXX XXXX ( WA ) XXXX XXXX This charge is for normal wear and tear in their terms and it is a violation of the State Statutes. 
1. This is also a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I am choosing to inform you that this attempt is in fact being disputed. It is also possible to seek financial damages from the violator which I would seek to the highest degree. 
2. Nova/Greystar has been paid in full. I also paid the water/sewer/garbage bill for an extra 3 month period as it was back dating from when the tenants were to begin to be charged but only informed 3 months after they already received the funds. This is a misappropriation of funds on the part which is another violation of the law. I just wanted to move so I paid it. 
That check is check # XXXX in the amount of {$180.00}. Nova/Greystar cashed this check and in the same envelope was an invoice showing it had been professionally cleaned as I usually do when vacating a property. 
3. In addition to point # 2, {$380.00} was the amount they have said that I owe them ( another letter stated {$370.00}? ) but your letter states {$200.00}. Why this difference? I see it is to my benefit but obviously they have internal administration issues. Ive gone through 5 different people in their organization that are aware of the facts.

4. They have refused to provide me with a copy of the lease renewal that I did sign. I did not see that there was a clause to pay their fees for cleaning of normal wear and tear such as the carpet cleaning that they state they had to do upon my vacating. The unit was left in pristine condition. This was definitely in my original lease from the 2 years previous. My original deposit was waived at move in due to my credit report and references from previous landlords. 
5. According to my records, I was only to need to pay Nova/Greystar an amount of {$37.00} for my pro rated water/sewer/garbage share and be done with it. They have continued to go beyond harassment. I moved out a week early end in XXXX and its now almost XX/XX/XXXX when Nova/Greystar has sent me to collections. An entire year later. 
6. My job is being a HUD Certified Housing Counselor. I have met with an attorney who has advised me that my conclusion of this fraudulent bill to me and other violations are accurate.

During the course of our investigation, our Fraud Investigations department was unsuccessful in contacting you regarding your fraud claims. -- -- -If you have even read my affidavit? I can't return your call when in XXXX even when I pay to call international, your 800 # was restricted. I was fast enough to pick up XXXX 's call once ( we have confirmed the id copy id fraud sent you was the expired lost/stolen copy of my old license!! ) while in XXXX but XXXX who actually IS the investigator never tried to call me even once. That's just for the first 2 months of the investigation. I flew back in XXXX and started to call you every day initiatively till XXXX. 

The initial police report information you provided was determined to be invalid by the XXXX Police Department. -- -- -- -- I have told you over the phone it was a temporary report # while in XXXX as I can't call international to local police department. I told you temp pr # already you can't use the word invalid, it's just not the final report #. I have given you 1 XXXX  police report for XXXX WHEN purse is lost and stolen which is legit report # but you hide it and never mentioned. 
I have later filed another discover fraud id theft police report XXXX with my local XXXX   police dept again, in XXXX when I came back from XXXX, which is also legit. Both legit police reports you are hiding and never even mentioned. 

In response to our request for validation of the disputed transactions, the merchant provided documentation including a copy of your drivers license, details of the services provided, copies of the signed receipts and signed consent forms -- -- -- -- -- Again their drivers license is that expired lost/stolen copy of my old license!! Other POS papers and consent papers, their descriptions can all be fraudulently produced!! YET you never mailed none of those id theft provided papers copy to me while I have challenged. 

Plus I have challenged you and id theft to provide my accurate current info and my physical exams data for the LEAST VITAL DATA that a XXXX $ medical procedure / medicines payment should at least have performed. Again none was provided. 

Plus they have XXXX of my personal insurance companies info. Right there is the flag of fraud. I use insurance for ALL MY MEDICAL NEEDS. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we again reviewed your claims per your assertions and provided temporary credits for the disputed transactions, pending the outcome of the investigation. As the outcome of the additional review determined no fraud occurred, the temporary credits were removed on XX/XX/XXXX -- -- -- -- -you did absolutely nothing for this so called "" re-investigation '' keep repeating all those lies TWISTED ACCOUNTS above is what I have heard every-time I have called you. 

The information you provided, including the fax received on XX/XX/XXXX, did not provide sufficient evidence to overturn the outcome of our investigation. -- -- -- - As your fraud supervisor requested I have faxed my current georgia driver license, affidavit and the police report XXXX is attached right here, these are what you wanted from me, how is that not sufficient? HOW IS THAT NOT SUFFICIENT? 

Additionally, we received information regarding an additional police report that was filed with the XXXX County Police Department that contained fraud allegations, but when contacted, the XXXX County Police Department advised that the report did not mention any specific charges being disputed or what type of card the alleged fraud occurred on. -- -- -- -- -- -- the police report you are talking about # XXXX is attached right here with our CFPB CASE XXXX. I invite everybody out there to judge the narrative part below : Found my dormant discover card being used for almost XXXX at/by XXXX 's business.

Fraud happening is the last time I want to think of ... ... .. 

HOW IN THE WORLD THE POLICE REPORT did not mention any specific charges being disputed or what type of card -- -- -DISCOVER CARD! If you have even read anything and did any "" investigations ''? None of the above twisted accounts and XXXX  XXXX lies will you type out. 

TOTALLY I HAVE PROVIDED TWO LEGIT POLICE REPORTS REGARDING THE TWO FRAUD TRANSACTIONS, XXXX police report # XXXX ( LOST STOLEN REPORT IN XXXX ) & POLICE REPORT XXXX ( DISCOVER FRAUD XX/XX/XXXX ) Although we consider your balance to be valid, due to your continued dispute, we have reported the account to the credit reporting agencies as disputed and will continue to report it as such unless you tell us to stop reporting it as disputed -- -- -- -- -- -another lie, pls tell all FOUR credit bureaus that this account is under fraud dispute and paid in full closed back at the end of XX/XX/XXXX statement. They are still reporting it as a normal opened LATE account in theirs. 

... ... ... .quote "" as mentioned previously, ever since XXXX paid the id theft about XXXX $ early this year ( XXXX while I was in XXXX ) without ever talking to me, the whole discover-fraud team has been reluctant to talk to me after she paid recklessly ( she paid fraud way before case expiration,  never allowed time for fair investigations ).

"-- Obtained {$7000.00} loan through Lending Tree/XXXX XXXX for XXXX work inXX/XX/XXXX ... XXXX referred us for loan and coordinated it. <P/>-- Loan specified 0 % interest, $ XXXX monthly payments due on XXXX of each month for 24 months -- We have made the {$290.00} payment every month from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX via our XXXX XXXX online bill pay -- It came to our attention in XX/XX/XXXX that Lending Tree was citing a late payment inXX/XX/XXXX and late fees. We had no idea why and called Lending Tree, found out  that they received the payment of {$290.00} one day late on XX/XX/XXXX. ( We are not sure what happened to cause the late receipt since we specify payment delivery on the due date in our online bill pay ... .we can see that the payment was withdrawn from our checking account onXX/XX/XXXX but, for whatever reason, Lending Tree did not receive it untilXX/XX/XXXX. ) During that phone call, we were told that they would grant us a one time waiver for that late payment and a refund of the penalty fees ( {$37.00} ). We reset our online bill pay for automatic payments to arrive on the XXXX of month ( a day prior to due date so there would hopefully be no chance of future late payments. ) -- We continued to pay our {$290.00} payments every month thereafter, always on time ( or ahead of time ) -- We do not receive paper statements and we do n't check our online account status since we are not making additional purchases on the account and all our payments are arriving on time. So we were not aware of any issue until we noticed a XXXX XXXX notification that we owe {$310.00} to Lending Tree this month ( not sure why we got a XXXX XXXX notification by email this time and not other times, or maybe we had no specific reason to check those notifications if we were getting them ... .we knew payments were made each month and arriving on time so we assumed there was no reason to check into our account further. ) -- We contacted Lending Tree Customer Service on XX/XX/XXXX ( they make it almost impossible to reach a live person ... .you have to work through their menu options futilely and press 0 continuously, get disconnected, then try again, etc ). When we finally got through, we spoke to 3 different customer service representatives ... each time we went through our whole saga, we were met with an explanation that made no sense to us and a roadblock. So we kept asking for our query to be elevated to the next manager. The last two managers we spoke  with were XXXX, then XXXX. XXXX said that she was the end of the line and we could n't elevate our case any further. -- We learned that even though we only made one late payment ( one day late ) and the penalties were waived and the late payment was excused, that late payment caused the next payment to have a different minimum amount due. Mind you, every other payment we have made has been on time and for the installment loan amount of {$290.00}, yet we have now incurred {$130.00} in late fees, even though Lending Tree supposedly waived penalties from our one late payment. Their reasoning seems to be that the XXXX late payment caused our XXXX payment to go up by {$5.00} due to fees that for some reason were n't waived and it was n't explained to us that they would n't be waived as party of the whole late payment fee waiver ... .so we owed {$290.00} in XXXX and we paid {$290.00}. Since we did n't pay the new amount, we incurred more late fees and the same thing continued to happen every month thereafter. To the best of my understanding, part of the rationale for this happening is that we called onXX/XX/XXXX about the XXXX late payment and ourXX/XX/XXXX payment had already been made for the wrong amount by that time and was not the new minimum payment due. While it completely mystifies me how we can be told by customer service that repercussions from a late payment have been waived and yet there is still a new minimum payment amount caused by the late payment that is n't waived, both XXXX and XXXX were completely dug in that this was completely justifiable. And because they only allow for one waiver of late fees, their hands are now tied. They insist that all charges are legitimate and if our next payment is n't the minimum due of {$310.00} ( since they divide all late fees over 24 months ), we will incur yet another {$37.00} late fee. <P/>-- OnXX/XX/XXXX we sent an email to XXXX XXXX, CEO, Lending Tree ... although customer service refused to give me the CEO 's name or email address or mailing address or phone number, I managed to find an email address online and am hoping it 's right since the email has not been returned. Emails were sent to XXXX and XXXX. We have not yet gotten a response ( but it has not yet been 24 hours since the letter was sent ). I will also forward the letter to the complaint address provided by customer service : XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, OH XXXX ( since Lending Tree is in XXXX, I do n't have much faith that this Ohio address is someplace that will actually take any more positive action on our behalf ). And, based on our interaction with customer service so far, I do n't have much hope that anything further will be addressed. <P/>-- We feel completely robbed by Lending Tree. It appears that they use whatever means necessary to extract funds from customers in order for their 0 % loans to be profitable. The whole experience feels extremely shady, distasteful and hopefully illegal.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

I explained that I never received any statement, information about this transfer, or anything to send them my payments, that I did n't know where they were coming up with such a large amount due, and that I had paid Fidelity. 

I then went on my XXXX XXXX XXXX homebanking to find records of my payments. XXXX XXXX XXXX, without informing me, had deleted Fidelity ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as a payee, along with all my payment history. I can find the payments on my statements, but no longer have a payee history record. 

I told this Elan company they would have to overnight to me all the documents they were required to give me, including statements, announcements, etc, before I could pay ; that I needed to find out what Fidelity did with my payments, and that I would be registering a complaint with the CFPB on how this was handled. 

If this has happened to me -- I 'm never late on my bills -- this is likely to have happened to many others during this transfer of companies. Even if it has n't, I do n't deserve late fees, collection, the hit to my credit report, or demands for a large cash payment by a company I 've never heard of.",Credit card or prepaid card

Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date.

The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ).

Four months of {$4900.00} have been automatically withdrawn from my checking account. When my Office Manager Reconciled and compared the withdrawals with the amortization scheduled she realized that all the money was applied to the Interest. At that point, she brought it to my attention.

She said she makes the final decision on Loans. She has no Supervisor. 

She keeps reiterating that all I can do is payoff the loan. That they will not reduce the balance by any portion of the Interest or Origination fee. The other option is to provide Bank Statements and offer a Settlement. The Settlement is not a guarantee and it will damage my  credit.

Sincerely California Interest Rate Laws Laws relating to interest rates in the State of California are dealt under various Statutes. According to Article XV ( Usury ) of the Constitution of the State of California, Section 1, the maximum rate of interest upon the loan or forbearance of any money, goods or things shall be seven percent per annum. At the same time, if parties agree upon in writing then the interest rate shall not exceed 10 percent per annum. As described in California Code, Uncodified Initiative Measures and Statutes 1919-1 Section 3, any person, company, association or corporation, who had paid any greater sum or value for any loan or forbearance than allowed under the law can recover treble the amount of the money so paid from any person, company, association or corporation who received such interest illegally. Under the same Section, any person who willfully  makes or negotiates for a loan of money, whereby s/he directly or indirectly charges interest for such loans in excess of that allowed by law, shall be punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than five years or in the county jail for not more than one year.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

To make matters worse they continued to send my documentation to the wrong departments for the next several weeks. At one point weeks and weeks into this, they re-characterized my loan from an XXXX loan to a XXXX loan!! AGAIN - pulling my credit and increasing my rate!!!

"I, XXXX XXXX, am a consumer as defined by 15 USC 1602 ( i ). On or around XX/XX/2015 I entered into a consumer credit transaction with Capital One. Pursuant to Federal law, a consumer credit transaction is a transaction in which a finance charge is involved. Pursuant to 15 USC 1605, a finance charge is the sum of ALL charges in a consumer credit transaction. As a consumer, and understanding what a consumer credit transaction is, I was not expecting a bill. During the course of this consumer credit transaction, I received multiple bills from Capital One which is a violation of 15 USC 1692b. Additionally, by sending me a bill, Capital One would be deemed a debt collector pursuant to 15 USC 1692a ( 6 ). Each statement for this alleged debt failed to disclose that the communication was from a debt collector which is a violation of 15 USC 1692. Additionally, each statement came with a positive balance. How can you pay on an account with a positive balance? This is a violation of 15 USC 1692e ( 2 ) ( A ).

Within 5 days of my initial communication with Capital One, they failed to provide me with the 5 requirements under 15 USC 1692g ( a ) which is a violation.

"In approximately XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill with a late fee attached from Discover card - whom I have been a longstanding, good faith customer.

I advised that I was not notified of this, they apologized, saying they 'd remove the late fee and we just needed to go through the process of reinstituting electronic payments again. I supplied my routing number and was told all was good to go. They again apologized stating I was a good customer that they did not want to lose. 
The following month I again received a late fee on my bill. This time I was much more perplexed and frankly, annoyed. I called again XX/XX/XXXX and asked immediately for a supervisor. I finally was connected with one who once again apologized profusely and said they must have entered my routing number incorrectly ... and I would have to go through the whole process of supplying that all over again. I reluctantly agreed - thinking I should just cancel the card - but was assured they would finally make it right this time. They again said they would absolutely remove the late fee due to their error.

I was told by XXXX that they are not allowed to transfer any matter once it starts with a certain person there but that XXXX would call me back when he got in that morning. Later that afternoon - after no return phone call - I called again.

"We opened a petty cash account with our other accounts at Wells Fargo so my wife could buy groceries or make other small purchases without accessing our main checking account which we used to pay for our larger monthly expenses e.g. mortgage, car payments, etc. 

We hadn't used the account in a few months and I noticed we had a small negative balance. When I checked I saw a {$30.00} fee being assessed monthly over the prior three months or so with no other charges. 

When I inquired with the bank on the reason for the fee, they advised it was associated to the type of account being a premier portfolio account. I advised that was an error and we only used the account for petty cash purchases. 

The representative apologized for the error and reversed the maximum of the fees she could access and noted the issue would need to be escalated and addressed by the investigations team, as it extended back over years. She further advised the issue would be resolved in a few days. I waited a week and checked to see if the fees had been returned, but they had not. I called the bank and was advised that no investigator had been assigned to my case but would be assigned soon. I waited another week and again contacted the bank and was again advised no investigator had been assigned, When I asked the representative to speak to a supervisor. I was told that supervisors did not speak to customers. I called the main customer service number and they escalated to the executive office and I was told once again that an investigator would need to review the case, but no time frame could be honestly provided. I was told I could call periodically to obtain status.

XXXX XXXX Senior Recruiter Direct Office XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, WA XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX XXXX, This letter is provided to you in compliance with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

As part of our employment selection process, we require that a consumer report be obtained before an offer of employment is made to any applicant being considered for the position for which you've applied. 

This is to advise you that your application for employment is being denied. In evaluating your application, the consumer reporting agency listed below provided us with the information which, in whole or in part, influenced our employment decision. This consumer reporting agency played no part in our decision other than providing the information about you, and the agency will not be able to provide you with specific reasons for our denial. 

Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you have the right to obtain a free copy of the consumer report directly from the consumer reporting agency listed below within sixty ( 60 ) days of the date of this letter. You also have the right to dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy or completeness of any information in the consumer report.

Clearly the credit bureaus have connected you in error to one of our child support cases. We can see this by the information you provided. However, we have no ability to make any updates on your report because we do not have any connection to you. We are unable to simply send credit bureaus information about someone who does not have an account with us. 



What we CAN do is verify our account information. You will need to file a dispute with all three credit bureaus Experian, XXXX and XXXX  because they are all showing on the report you shared with us. In order to prove to the credit bureaus that this account does not belong to you, I suggest you provide as much information as possible in every dispute such as current address and previous addresses, full middle name, date of birth and phone number. Our case is also a XXXX XXXX but with a different middle name and clearly different addresses etc. When we receive the disputes, the more items we can mark as different than the information you provide, the better chance you have of getting the credit bureaus to remove the wrong information from your record. 



You can file disputes electronically with the credit bureaus and they come through on a list to us within a day or two from the credit bureaus. I will personally watch for your disputes and respond to them as soon as we receive them to expedite the clearing of your record.

"With the following statement and attached documents I want to show an error in the Outstanding Principal Balance of my mortgage loan. 

My original loan mortgage amount is {$160000.00}. As for ( XX/XX/XXXX), I  made a total of 14 regular monthly mortgage loan payments. The regular monthly payment amount ranged from XXXX XXXX, and the regular monthly amount applied towards the Principal Balance ranged from {$270.00} to XXXX ( {$270.00} average ). If we keep it simple, 14 payments at  {$270.00} equals a total of {$3800.00} that should have been applied towards my Principal Balance. Therefore, my outstanding Loan Principal should be of approx. {$150000.00} and NOT of {$150000.00} as it shows in my last loan statement ( XXXXXX/XX/XXXX ). 

The origin of this error is a cascade of miss-adjustments done by Huntington Bank in XXXXXX/XX/XXXX to reverse an automatic regular payment done from my Asterisk Free Huntington Checking account towards the Principal of my loan on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I used to pay ( XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX) up front monthly regular payments with personal checks as shown in Transaction History attached document. I was not aware that Huntington Bank set up automatic payments from my free asterisk checking account until I received a notification of Not Sufficient Funds ( NSF ) in XX/XX/XXXX. At that moment, I requested a reversal of {$1000.00} to my checking account and to suspend automatic payments from my Huntington Free Asterisk Checking Account in order to avoid double monthly payments ( Personal checks and Huntington Checking Account ) This statement and the documentation provided ( Loan Payments -Transaction History MSU-FCU, Asterisk Account History ) with this letter should clarify this issue. I demand an immediate action to correct my principal balance : a reimbursement of approx. {$780.00} towards the Principal Balance of my mortgage loan. 

After all it has been 1 year since I brought this problem to the attention of Huntington Bank and despite my efforts, it has not been solved yet.

I made several calls back and forth with my Bank 's Fraud Protection Line and their Customer Service Lines, which are Two Seperate Departments that do not appear to Communicate with each other at all. Each Call I had to make with my Bank, I had to tell this story ALL over again, with a Brand New Person. Even within the Customer Service Department I had to Repeat Myself Again and again.

Eventually either on XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I Called the Customer Service Line of My Bank and went through the whole story again, and asked if it was correct that I should call my Website 's company directly and give them my New Credit Card Information over the phone, so they could be paid for the services they fulfilled a month prior, OR would they be paid by the Bank when they reversed the Mistaken Fraud Charge on my Original Credit Card that my Bank had Mistakenly Canceled For No Reason.

They said YES when I suggested the Idea of Calling the Company and giving them my New Credit Card information.

Sure enough I was promptly charged TWICE for the same services. 

Once for {$56.00} and a Processing fee of {$1.00} on XX/XX/XXXX AND a "" Forced Post Ach Withdrawl Adjustment '' for {$31.00} and {$24.00} on XX/XX/XXXX {$31.00} and {$24.00} add up to {$56.00}, I don't know why my Bank didn't include the Processing fees, I guess they just kept that money for some reason. Another of their many Mistakes. 

I called Customer Services and the Fraud Protection Lines. Fraud Protection told me that the Claim was "" Closed '' so they couldn't Reopen it for some reason, and that my only recourse was to file a New Claim of a "" Duplicate Charge '' with the Customer Servive Line. Which I promptly did. I informed Customer Service I was on a Fixed Income as I am On XXXX and I also had Timed Withdrawls for Bills Due out of my Account that Would be covered had they not Overdrawn my account with their mistake. They assured me they were on top of it. 

They were not, But when Overdraft fees Were drawn out of my account they were imediately refunded by my Bank and eventually they did correct their mistake and Refunded my charge on my New Credit Card of {$56.00} and the Processing Fee of {$1.00}. Apparently, my Bank wanted to keep the original processing Fee, which I assume they still have. 

I considered the matter closed until I recently on XX/XX/XXXX i went on my Bank Account Website to balance my checkbook and I noticed a suprising and shocking Negative balance. 

My Account was Overdrawn because out of nowhere and with No notice from my bank, no E-mails, no Phone Calls, Nothing ... I noticed the following charges on my account.

I informed XXXX that we had not received the gift cards and asked what my options were. XXXX put me on hold to check the status of the cards. When he got back on the line, XXXX informed me that all of the 24 gift cards had been used and that he was going to open a fraud investigation to look into a resolution. He told me to "" not worry '' and that I would have a resolution within 7-10 business days. I asked him if I should submit a credit card dispute to which XXXX said no and suggested we wait until we hear back from the investigation team. We waited. 
I then called American Express gift card services on XX/XX/XXXX to check status and was told that this was still being investigated and that I would "" for sure '' hear from someone the following week. I did not receive any updates. I then called gift card services on XX/XX/XXXX to check status and was told that the investigation was still showing open and was being worked on. I was also told that there no updated notes and that there was no one in the investigation dept that we can request status from. I asked to then speak with a supervisor who told me the same thing and said that my only option was to wait.

"I need your help to get XXXX XXXX XXXX  to fix what they have done to our family since XX/XX/XXXX. My son was born with XXXX XXXX and as a result struggles in school even today. When he was in XXXX XXXX, he struggled and the school wanted to hold him back even though he was already in a XXXX XXXX XXXX program. After going back and forth with the administration it became clearly apparent that the school had very limited resources and was not the best for him. As a father and as a family, we made the decision to find the best school for him in our local region and we would move there to make sure he had the best chance he could at life. In trying to do this we quickly ran into problems as we found out that XXXX XXXX XXXX had some tradelines on my wife 's credit file for some hospital bills they claimed that we owed. After learning more about our rights and protections, we traced back an intricate web of hollow companies essentially set up to avoid legal liability. As a XXXX XXXX XXXX myself, I understand that this is the whole point of why corporations are around ; however, over time I realized that this was more insidious than that. No, this was not just a way of leveraging a corporate entity to avoid liability, this was in fact a clear example of a subterfuge that was designed and put in place not just to be mean. No, this was an instrument to defraud everyday people of their rights as consumers. As XXXX XXXX was at the very top, leading this intricate web of sham corporations, XXXX leaves him ultimately responsible for the ethical directions, illegal actions, and deceptive practices he was and is using the corporation under him for. No. From Tenet all the way down to XXXX XXXX XXXX, the corporations and entities are just operating and being used as tools for whatever fraudulent actions XXXX XXXX directs them to do. In submitting five written requests for validation directly to XXXX XXXX 's attention, we understood from responses that he had personally taken to the task of getting this fixed, but he ultimately did nothing even while he had the power and authority to fix this all. We filed a small claims court civil suit and we were awarded {$1100.00} and they would remove the unvalidated tradelines from my wife 's file, but this did not happen until XX/XX/XXXX. This is where this really upset me as a father, a husband, and a person. Since early XX/XX/XXXX we had problems qualifying for mortgages and lost opportunities to move and get my son into the school that could help him the most for his medical conditions. This became amplified, finding out that there was a consent order from the CFPB for XXXX XXXX XXXX about this very same issue in XX/XX/XXXX to stop doing these things and fix the problems, but XXXX XXXX in spite of this had the audacity to show up and defend the indefensible. Tenet Healthcare through XXXX XXXX XXXX was and is represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Call her at ( XXXX ) XXXX or email her at XXXX and she can tell you herself that she even had the audacity to tell us she wanted to settle and just be patient all along. She had been lying to us all along. Then she went and told us that on XX/XX/XXXX she had perfected her appeal to the county court even knowing full well that the consent order was already out there and XXXX XXXX XXXX was ordered to take affirmative action to do the right thing. In XX/XX/XXXX we finally closed on a house so XXXX could get to the school he needed. This is why I am and will be upset and driven to let Tenet Healthcare and XXXX XXXX know how they have hurt my family every opportunity I get moving forward.

I called Conns and was quoted a higher balance than I was suppose to have. I spoke to a representative at Conns about this matter. The representative advised me that due to them processing my payment and it returning due to lack of funds that the zero interest option would no longer be available and that I was now responsible for paying the interest on the account. I explained to the representative that I made my payment via checking account as I have done with every other payment prior to this one and what was the reason for them processing my payment via savings. The representative advised me that I chose the savings option for payment on the automated line. Be advised that the automated line system makes long pauses while making choices to process your payment and could of incorrectly have taken the payment in the wrong way. The representative advised me to send my bank statement in showing that I had the funds available in my checking account when I made the payment and that they would conduct a investigation. I called back several weeks later and was advised that although the funds were in my account they werent going to remove the interest. I feel that this was a deceptive practice by Conns to ensure that I paid interest.,"Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"JP Morgan Chase defrauds credit card customers with hidden interest rate charges related to zero interest loans. 

Situation : Earlier this year I borrowed a zero percent credit card loan from my JP Morgan Chase Credit Card. Later I found I was being charged interest of 17.49 % p.a. on purchases, but on what amount of purchases? It was not disclosed on the credit card statement. After telephone calls with Chase, I found that the only way to determine the purchase amount was to subtract the zero interest loan balance from the credit card balance as shown on the statement, but the zero interest loan balance was also not shown on the credit card statement. In June I had to speak with a Chase credit card representative to find out the zero interest loan balance.

I spoke with representatives twice. The first explanation of the interest charges was vague, confusing and incorrect. The second was correct. I was told the amount of the loan balance and the method to eliminate the interest charges : sequentially first pay off the minimum amount due ( {$140.00} in my case ), then separately pay off the purchases ( {$220.00} in my case ), calculated as follows : Amount Source Credit Card Balance {$14000.00} Credit Card Statement ( Exhibit 1 ) Less Zero Interest Loan {$14000.00} Chase Representative ( by Phone ) Purchases {$220.00} My Calculation on which 17.49 % Interest is to be Charged Interest Charges {$2.00} Credit Card Statement ( Exhibit 1 ) JP Morgan Chases practices are deceptive and fraudulent, resulting in consumers unknowingly paying punitively high interest charges without knowing how to avoid them.

"Company admits their error in delaying loan modification resulting in negative credit reporting, yet refuses to correct their error on credit report. 

In a letter in response to the CFPB complaint on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Wells Fargo clearly admitted their error when they stated : "" A review of your account confirms that the information you provided to us on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, was the information that was required from you in order to clear title so we could move forward with the settlement of the loan modification. We are moving forward with the final decision based on the trial plan approved XXXX XXXX, XXXX and the modification approved XXXX XXXX, XXXX. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. '' Inconvenience, really? The emotional pain and suffering from not being able to obtain housing, employment, rental cars, credit cards due to their erroneous credit reporting was beyond inconvenient. According to Wells Fargo 's own admission, they are directly responsible for the late payments they are reporting to the CRAs from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. 

However, this is not the end of the story. They had also unjustifiably denied my 2 other previous attempts to cure this delinquency. First, in XX/XX/XXXX after I had completed my 3 trial payments in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, they simply stated their reason for cancelling my loan mod was : "" the program had changed and I no longer fit in the parameters of the new program. '' In their letter dtd, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, they patently lied when they responded to this allegation when they said : "" you informed us that you were unemployed and unable to continue with the post-HAMP trial payments. '' The fact is that they refused to take another payment from me for the above mentioned reason of "" no longer fit in the parameters. '' Again, in this same letter they completely fabricated the story that "" they were not in receipt of the requested financial information. '' in regards to the special forbearance program I was approved for in XXXX but unable to complete after faxing my documents in no less than XXXX times. 

Wells Fargo initially claimed this was the case on the XX/XX/XXXX loan modification, but after I got the XXXX Attorney General involved, the truth came forward. If they initially lied about the XXXX loan mod, how hard is it to believe they also lied about the XXXX and XXXX attempts. 

I acknowledge that the initial delinquency in XXXX was my responsibility. But by every right, the first loan modification in XXXX should have been completed. Because of Wells Fargo 's error they have been reporting 56 late payments on my mortgage to the CRAs, which has completely decimated my financial life and has caused untold pain and suffering.",Mortgage

While the servicer is willing to engage in a modification, they are so far refusing to postpone the sale, which is scheduled for Monday, XX/XX/XXXX.

"Due to XXXX XXXX my husband and I filed bankruptcy in XXXX. We did not include our second mortgage with 5/3 Bank trying to avoid losing our home. From the time of filing Chapter XXXX, to the judges review of our case, there had been a gross miscalculation ( about {$600.00} to $ XXXXMonth ) of monthly payment we would have to make to the bankruptcy court. We have XXXX boys and the difference in payment along with health insurance premium & high deductible, we surely would have a hard time paying 5/3 Bank the full monthly payment. 

We reached out to 5/3 Bank, explaining our family 's hardship, asking if somehow, we could lower interest just to help us afford the payment. What was sent to us we couldn't so tried very hard to continue payment. Eventually we ran out of payment coupons sent to 5/3 with payment and called to request another book. I again asked if there was anything we could do to lower our payments and was told since we filed bankruptcy, I would not receive a new payment book and the agent could not speak with me. I was also informed if I could not afford full payment to remit what we could, which we did. 

On XX/XX/XXXX our bankruptcy was discharged due to hardship. 5/3 Bank sent correspondence to us after the discharge stating we immediately owed {$56000.00} which was reported to the credit bureau on XX/XX/XXXX. After the loan was discharged, we spoke to the Recovery Department and agreed to make monthly payments which we do make. 

In working very hard to rebuild our credit I'm happy to say we have been successful! Over the previous years we have put aside house repairs and are now badly in need. Recently we approached a bank to possibly refinance and combine our first mortgage with the amount due to 5/3 Bank. We however are unable to get an amount from 5/3 Bank that we can understand. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received a phone message 5/3 Bank needed to speak to me regarding our account. I knew it was their quarterly call confirming monthly payments, I had also attempted calling a couple days before but could not reach them because of high call volume. Returning their message, I spoke to an agent who told me the balance was {$44000.00}. I wanted to report to her we would continue monthly payments, but she said she needed to transfer me to the recovery department where I spoke with XXXX. I also explained to him about needing a balance since we may refinance. He told me we owed {$57000.00}. I was shocked at the difference and asked him to explain to me. He said the {$13000.00} additional amount is due to interest & fees. I asked him to please provide me with a breakdown showing when the interest & fees were added to the account. Initially he told me he could not give me that breakdown. I explained that if we owed the larger amount, I wanted to make sure because of the large difference. He said he would try to talk to someone who "" maybe '' could, and it would take 3-5 business days and to receive the information I would have to call back. 

I then spoke with the loan officer we currently are working with and he is also unsure of the balance due to 5/3 Bank since {$44000.00} was reported to the credit bureau on XX/XX/XXXX. 

on XXXX XXXX I again received a message on my cell phone to call 5/3 Bank. I did and spoke with XXXX. I informed her I would continue making monthly payments. I also asked her to verify our balance since I was given two different amounts by their reps. She told me {$57000.00} was due. Then she said, "" oh, wait a minute '' and put me on hold. 
Came back on the line and said, yes, that is what was due. She offered a pay off letter which I thanked her for. I explained we also needed an accounting of the account showing dates the interest and fees were added. She said she could request an account history be sent to me but it would not specifically show dates the charges were added to the account. I again tried to explain I felt it was my right to know this information, especially since the difference of the two amounts is {$13000.00} - which is a huge amount to us!

We were originally approved for a principal reduction with XXXX XXXX prior to our loan being transfer to SPS under the MHA streamline program.
Our loan was subsequently transferred to a new MBS as a means of not finalizing our government backed modification.
The original loan was entered into by my wife under duress while I was deployed to XXXX with the United States XXXX XXXX.
Due to the recovery period from my injuries and my inability to fully understand and respond to this process effectively we have been exploited in regards to this loan.
The modification paperwork covers up the fact the our principal balance is increasing by {$2500.00} in fees.
The loan is being recast from roughly 220 months to 393 months.
The LTV on the home is roughly 158 % after the modification.

"I went to XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX, 2018 with my partner and on our way out, we stopped by Kay Jewelers to inquire how much it would cost to resize and clean our rings. The store associate who assisted us was XXXX and then the store manager, XXXX. XXXX had me fill out information so I could leave my ring for resizing and cleaning. He said I had to fill it all out and sign at the bottom so I would be able to be registered in the system and pick up my ring. However, he proceeded to take my information, ran my credit, and used my information to pre-approve and apply for a credit card without my consent. I am very well educated with credit and how it works. He ran my credit and applied for a credit card without my consent. I was furious that he did this without my permission when he said this information was just to register me in the computer to set up my account to pay for the order. 

I asked the manager why he thought it was okay to lie to me and apply for a credit card without my consent. The associate was well aware of what was going on because he was embarrassed and went to hide in the back until we left. I asked for the district manager 's contact information and he refused to give it to me. The store manager, XXXX, proceeded to laugh and say it's not a big deal, you'll get a card now and be able to shop. I had no intention to ever get a new credit card especially for Kay Jewelers. He laughed at me and said "" if it's such a big deal, when you receive the card, just cut it and call and cancel it, no big deal! '' I left the store incredibly upset. 

I immediately went on XXXX for Kay Jewelers customer service and I called customer service and they refused to give me any information. The associate on the phone just said to cancel the card when I receive it. 

The pre-approval process runs your credit. When you run your credit, it lowers it. When you apply for a credit card, it runs your credit. This is something I never wanted. 

I finally got a hold of the district manager, Georgia XXXX XXXX, and I explained my situation. She said there was nothing she could do on her part, but to talk to the store manager. She offered a free ring clean when I stop by a particular mall that is out of my way. 

My concern is the manager lied to a customer, me, and asked for information and wrongfully used it to apply for a credit card that the customer never wanted and saying it was the registration form to be in the system and drop off a ring. That's a huge fraud problem in itself. Second, the company did nothing about it and didn't fix the situation and my credit took a toll through it all. Third, I don't even want to know how many times the associates or store manager at  this location have wrongfully done this to countless of innocent customers/people window shopping at their store. Incredibly wrong. 
After this incident, it's sad to say that their reviews verify that this has been an issue in the past and I refuse to use Kay Jewelers for anything.

Granted, their fee policies and rates are disclosed, however what is NOT disclosed is that customers can trade on Coinbase Pro, an alternative platform owned by the same company, for 0 % fees for certain types of trades.

Before incurring over {$450.00} of transaction fees, I was NOT notified that I could place my orders on Coinbase Pro for {$0.00} in fees for limit orders. It is unfair that the same trading options are not provided on Coinbase, which trading options retail investors could use to avoid incurring substantial fees. There is no significant level of sophistication required to understand the difference between a transaction that incurs fees and one that does not.

Coinbase appears to be preying on the ignorance of new investors by steering them into a more expensive trading platform that does not add any value to the customer.

"My existing mortgage loan on my personal residence originated on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, it was properly disclosed to me that Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ) was required on this loan. The Private Mortgage Insurance Disclosure that I signed stated that I could request removal of this PMI on XX/XX/XXXX. Also in this disclosure under "" Automatic Termination of PMI '' at the bottom of the page, the form says, "" ... PMI will automatically terminate on the date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 78 % of the original value of the property. This date is XX/XX/XXXX. '' This commitment to automatically terminate the PMI is the crux of my complaint since the mortgage holder is currently refusing to honor this term of the contract although I fully meet all qualifications. See attachment titled "" PMI Disclosure XXXX. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, my mortgage loan was transferred to Specialized Loan Servicing ( SLS ) as evidenced by the attachment "" Mortgage Transfer to SLS Letter XXXX. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a written request to SLS for removal of the PMI. In error, I referenced the original account number assigned at loan closing instead of the new number given by SLS. SLS stamped, ""  RECEIVED XX/XX/XXXX '' on the letter, crossed out the original loan number and wrote in the SLS loan number which indicates to me that they knew the loan to which I was referring. See attachment titled, "" Original Request to Remove PMI XXXX. '' SLS responded to my XXXX request with a letter dated XXXX stating that SLS "" no longer services the loan associated with this property. '' I believe that SLS knew this was not the case because they placed the correct loan number on their letter. To me, this was clearly an attempt by SLS to get me to drop the issue. See attachment titled "" First Response to Request XXXX. '' I tried again on XXXX by submitting my second written request to remove the PMI. This time I listed the correct SLS loan number and included a copy of the Private Mortgage Insurance Disclosure given me at time of loan origination. See attachment titled "" Second Request to Remove PMI XXXX. '' SLS responded to my XXXX request by sending me the attached letter named "" Second Response to Request XXXX. '' In short, this correspondence says that they will only consider removing the PMI once a valuation is done on the home. These valuations are estimated in this letter to range in cost from $ XXXX {$800.00}. Considering that the PMI cost to me is {$54.00} per month AND knowing that my contract says that the PMI will automatically terminate on XX/XX/XXXX, I begrudgingly decided to not pursue the PMI termination before XXXX because it would cost me more than it would save. So, in other words, I decided to simply wait until XXXX at which time I believed the issue would resolve itself. 

When I received my statement from SLS for my XX/XX/XXXX payment, I noticed that the PMI figure of {$54.00} was still being billed. Thinking that surely this would be the last month that would happen due to the automatic termination on XXXX, I decided to not approach SLS at that time. 

Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received my XXXX billing from SLS which is attached titled, "" SLS Current Billing for XXXX. '' In it, once again the {$54.00} for PMI was billed for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called SLS yet again last night and waited on hold for over 30 minutes. When I finally got through to a live person, they told me that PMI would not be removed until my loan balance reached 78 % of the original loan amount of {$250000.00} even though my loan documents say, "" 78 % of the original value. '' If this were true - which it is not according to the PMI Disclosure - the PMI would continue to be build until I pay my loan down by {$21000.00}. At that point, my loan-to-value on my home would be at 70 % according to the appraisal completed in conjunction with this home loan refinance in XXXX of XXXX. A summary page from the appraisal is attached titled, "" Appraisal Summary XXXX. '' My calculations show that continuing to pay SLS for PMI until I reach 78 % of the original loan balance ( not the property value ) would require me to make eighteen more payments of {$54.00} totaling {$970.00} more than I should have to pay. It should be noted that my loan with SLS has been, is and will remain completely current on all payments at all times. 

In summary, Specialized Loan Servicing has acted willfully to frustrate and ignore my efforts to remove the PMI requirement on my loan so that they may collect {$970.00} more from me than they are entitled. It would seem reasonable to assume that this company is successfully scamming many thousands of other unsuspecting consumers in this same manner. I hereby request the assistance of the CFPB to resolve this issue.",Mortgage
"In XXXX, my husband and I purchased a motor home financed by Bank of the West in California. For six years we diligently made the {$610.00} a month payment, totaling about {$46000.00} on the {$70000.00} loan. The interest rate was very high at the time. As we increasingly felt the effect of the XX/XX/2008 crisis and we lost a lot of income, we could no longer afford those payments. We prevailed on Bank of the West to refinance our loan. They told us they would not even consider it because we were current in our payments -- we needed to be at least 90 days in arrears. So we let our payments lapse and used the money to make other financial obligations. Then they said they would not refinance the loan : bottom line they repossessed our motor home. They sold it at auction for {$20000.00} despite the fact that we had found a buyer for {$30000.00} who they refused to consider. Then they told us we owed them {$50000.00}. They would n't even take into consideration the money already paid over a six year period. They set us up on a payment plan of {$150.00} a month. Fast forward three years : we have been making payments religiously, and have paid down {$5000.00}, but they report us to the credit bureaus ( I have written XXXX, XXXX and XXXX but I have not heard anything ) as though we are always 30 days late when we are not.

"On or about XX/XX/XXXX I opened a Home Equity Line of Credit with Wachovia Bank which was subsequently taken over by Wells Fargo Bank. The HELOC was originally for {$250000.00} and later reduced to about {$180000.00} when I refinanced my original first mortgage.
The Line of Credit was an interest only loan and every month without fail I paid the interest that I was billed for. To my knowledge I WAS NEVER LATE ON A PAYMENT and was never charged a late fee. The monthly bills indicated that the balance shown was the entire balance including any unpaid interest ( which I assumed was only for the previous month. ) Please see the highlighted section of the attached typical bill. Please note the beginning and ending balances appear but NO ITEMIZED EXPLANATION as to how those figures are derived. lt was always my assumption therefore that when I paid the amount due on time I would billed for the same amount of interest the following month provided the rate did not change in which case the amount was either lower or higher.
I recently sold the home used for collateral and therefore asked for a "" payoff '' amount. I was given the amount and now verbally told that it included "" unpaid interest of {$2100.00}. '' I immediately asked for a detailed explanation since I was totally shocked at this revelation. The written answer I received, ( attached ) is totally unintelligible. The banker at the local bank where the loan originated could not explain the letter to me. Basically it merely is an accounting of how unpaid interest accrues but since I paid the total interest owed each month it makes no sense to me. It appears that the bank sometimes applied my payments to interest and sometimes THEY DID NOT, creating unpaid interest carrying over to the following month. The following month 's payment made on time and for the full amount billed was perhaps partially applied to interest but sometimes not at all creating even additional unpaid interest fees. AGAIN THERE WAS NEVER A DETAILED EXPLANATION PROVIDED. As an example please refer to the attached list of payments for XX/XX/XXXX It shows a Finance Charge of {$550.00}, a regular payment of {$800.00} and {$0.00} paid to interest. Further, refer to XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX Although I made regular payments they show none applied to interest My issue, REGARDLESS OF HOW THE BANK CALCULATES THE INTEREST, is that while allegedly unpaid interest was accruing I WAS NEVER INFORMED AND NEVER GIVEN AN OPPORTUNITY TO PAY. In my opinion this is an intentional hidden way for the bank to increase revenue without fully and honestly informing its customer. It is outrageous that a, till now, reputable bank can run up fees for a customer without his knowledge and get away with it. This has to be illegal! It appears to me that the millions of dollars in fines they have been assessed has merely served as a licensing fee to continue stealing from their customers.",Mortgage
"Part ( 1 ) : On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I engaged in good faith, the purchase of a 2016 Nissan Juke with XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Salesman. Upon receipt of the documents, lease documents and registration, I immediately requested that XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX salesman to make the necessary changes to the sales paperwork to reflect that I was purchasing a 2016 vehicle. The salesman, the Dealership and Finance company all collectively refused to make the necessary corrects to the paperwork. On XXXX XXXX, 2016, with no viable or amicable alternative, I returned the car to the Dealership, located at : XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. 
I am asking that the Car I am driving from the XXXX XXXX XXXX Dealership want sell the car or Repo the Car until a Decision has been made in this case.

Upon information and belief, through further investigation and discovery, I believes that there may be a routine pattern and practice of false misrepresentation on the part of the dealing toward other senior citizens and veterans customers. I would appreciate if CFPB to take a serious look at this matter. 
I was quoted $ XXXX monthly car note at 29 %, by XXXX salesman XXXX XXXX XXXX, which would fit within my fixed XXXX Veteran monthly allowance from the VA. However, when the sales documen arrived from the Finance company ( Capital One Finance ) company, for the Rogue vehicle, the monthly note was : {$600.00}. The Salesman and Dealership, once again, just as the first purchase transaction, without my knowledge and without full disclosure to me, referred this transaction for Financing to none other than, the same Capital One Auto Finance. 
Moreover, to add insult to injury, the same Salesman, XXXX issued State required ( Gap Insurance ) at the time of the sales transaction. ( 10 days ) later the same Salesman XXXX XXXX contacted me requesting that I come to the Dealership. Upon arrival at the Dealership he revoked the State Regulatory requirements issued with the purchase of a vehicle. He then proceeded to tear up the original sales contract and the ( Gap Insurance ) policy. In violation of State regulatory requirements. The Salesman then re-issued a New Sales Purchase contract for the citing, instead that I must obtain Insurance for the car from another Insurance company. Therefore, I remain without ( Gap Insurance ) on the Rogue vehicle. When I subsequently reported the matter to the Capital One Finance company, the Capital One Finance, Agent stated that the actions taken by the Salesman ( XXXX XXXX was illegal and said that the Resolution Dept. Of Capital One Finance company will launch an investigation of the matter, which they did not do. I respectfully submit to you with a great deal of certainty that there is a pattern of ( fraud, deception, and false misrepresentation by omission of facts in violation of truth in their lending laws ; at least to vulnerable Veterans, seniors and perhaps other disenfranchised citizens of XXXX XXXX county. 
I am currently receiving medical treatments for stage XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX and XXXX caused by the actions of the XXXX Dealership have taken an extreme toll on my medical condition and the quality of my life. I have made several attempts to amicably resolve this matter by reaching out to the XXXX Dealership, to no avail. I respectfully requests that an amicable resolution be reached by CFPB. Thank you.

Starting XX/XX/2017 I switched my monthly payment date to the XXXX of each month and I began to make extra payments towards the loan with the highest interest rate. I do automatic monthly payments since its easier and I supposedly get a discount on interest rates. I have 5 total loans with Discover. Every month since XX/XX/2017 the company has failed to distribute my money appropriately amongst each loan for my monthly payments. They also failed to put my extra payments towards the loan with the highest rate. Instead they would distribute it among the 4 loans and nothing towards the highest interest rate loan. There would be months at a time where none of my monthly payments would be going to a certain loan so I would get behind on that loan and then owe a ton of interest on it two months later. I have tried for the past three months to get this fixed and the first time they attempted to fix it it was not done correctly so I emailed them an example of exactly how I wanted my money distributed. A month later they sent me a letter saying they couldnt do it. I have tried calling them numerous times and emailing them numerous times for the past several months and have gotten nowhere.,Student loan

"I am concerned that my mortgage servicing company, Wells Fargo, recently ( XX/XX/XXXX ) hired a real estate appraiser who provided a ridiculously low home valuation, thereby enabling Wells Fargo to keep PMI on the mortgage. The PMI costs us about {$100.00} per month. I also had to pay Wells Fargo {$100.00} to get this Broker Price Opinion ( BPO ). The house was purchased in XX/XX/XXXX for $ XXXX ( after having initially been listed for $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ) during the height of the real estate boom ). 

The BPO only had to get our home value to $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ) to remove PMI. XXXX suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. XXXX   suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. XXXX suggests the home is now worth $ XXXX. However, amazingly, the BPO concluded the house 's present value was only $ XXXX ( $ XXXX/sq.ft. ), thereby preventing removal of PMI. The BPO acknowledged the existence of $ XXXX of added-value improvements since purchase, but apparently the broker did not feel those improvements added any actual value to the home. The BPO suggested a power washing of {$800.00}, and found nothing else deficient with the house. 

By contrast, in XX/XX/XXXX the house across the street from us sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft., in XX/XX/XXXX the house two doors down from us sold for $ XXXXsq.ft. In XX/XX/XXXX, a house around the corner sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft. In XX/XX/XXXX, an older, significantly smaller house three doors up from us sold for $ XXXX/sq.ft. ( These figures are all verifiable at XXXX ). Disappointingly, none of these sales were considered in the broker 's BPO. The broker found it preferable to compare us to homes miles away instead. We only needed to get to $ XXXX/sq.ft. to remove PMI, and it baffles us how the broker could not reach that figure given the average actual price for square foot in our immediate neighborhood. My wife and I feel cheated by this BPO purchase from Wells Fargo, who has an incentive to keep PMI on the mortgage. We feel that maintaining PMI is very unfair given the reality of the actual local real estate market.",Mortgage

As I am not the person who owes this bill, I am aware that providing the information requested may lead to third party disclosure : a HIPAA violation. That would be your problem and not mines, as a consumer. And per the FCRA and FCPA, I am not required to complete a police report since the burden to prove the debt is on you.

"On XX/XX/XXXX Financed a used XXXX XXXX XXXX Sport from XXXX XXXX. We put down {$2000.00} as a down payment on the vehicle that was priced at {$19000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.Prior to meeting with the finance department , we had instructed not to install the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( {$570.00} ), instead we cared more about the maintenance of the vehicle and opted for a service contract instead of the XXXX XXXX. We had signed a contract that day for 72 months, finance percentage of 19.15 %. Due to being an XXXX for XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) an XXXX discount was to be applied to the purchase of a vehicle ; which was never applied. 

XX/XX/XXXX we came back to the dealership and without receiving any confirmation of the finance agreement nor the original copy of the finance contract ; we were persuaded to apply an additional {$500.00} to the vehicle, for a payment. The contract was then written up but the {$500.00} was applied towards our down payment and were told not to worry it still goes towards the car. The Finance Department added on four items to the list price of the vehicle : 1 )  XXXX {$990.00} 2 ) XXXX XXXX   {$570.00} 3 ) XXXX XXXX ( Extended Warranty ) {$2000.00} 4 ) GAP {$850.00} This added to the total cost of vehicle plus tax, registration fees etc. equaled {$23000.00} for the final financed amount. First payment of {$540.00} was due XX/XX/XXXX, but we had waited to hear back from Honda Financial Services ( HFS ) regarding the XXXX discount ; ten days later they informed us there was n't an XXXX discount applied and they would remove the late fee charge of XXXX for the month of XX/XX/XXXX. 

Additionally, the XXXX XXXX Device, which we said NO to, was still installed in the vehicle, except the wires that were connected were melting off, causing the wires to have a wet look and would hit the drivers left leg while driving, causing pain and distraction. Had taken the vehicle to another dealership to look at the security system and told to take it back and have it removed immediately but they could n't perform the removal. Took it back to the original dealership which did n't help the situation.

During this procedure, we have been threatened that any missed payments will be reflected in our credit reports and will have an adverse affect. HFS representatives also acted rude with name calling, threatening tone of voice and failed to listen or help in any manner, as if we inconvenienced them. 

As of XX/XX/XXXX this account was moved to a charge off reported on our credit reports without any written notice of additional debt, failure to report posted payments, failure to cancel and apply refunded amounts, applying payments incorrectly, while incurring late payment fees of XXXX four additional times.

"On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX I went online to make a transfer from my savings account into one of my checking accounts with Regions Bank. I noticed in my online portal that there were some pending charges. I also noticed that I was assessed an overdraft fee of {$100.00}, however, the balance at the time the fee was assessed was not negative. I completed my transfer and called to get clarification. The representative told me that while the pending charges had not been taken from my account ( or even been requested from the merchants ) they had preemptively applied them to my balance, thus creating a negative balance and charging XXXX separate overdraft fees to previously made transactions that had already posted, even though the balance after these transactions was still positive. I was rather confused, because this same policy is not applied to deposits, even if transferred with another account within the same bank. When I pushed the issue, I was told that my banking portal was not the same portal that the bank uses, and therefore they were seeing charges and assessing fees based on their interface. Basically, while customers have access to the transactions on their account right away in the portal, the online interface does not calculate balance in the same way that the associate interface calculates balance. So, while customers see that transactions have been covered with a running, positive balance, the bank sees something different. This is deliberately deceptive and misleading. Although the bank claims that this online banking interface is just a "" tool, '' the fact that they do, in fact, have access to information that they are not updating in the portal leads to issues with customers ' understanding of their bank balance, especially when transactions are posted in the customer portal in such a way that it appears that the balance available is still positive. Assessing fees based on projected fund withdrawal, while not counting projected funds deposited is unfair and, at best, questionable. I would be interested to know how much money Regions bank has stolen from customers by assessing fees based on projected account activity. If this is their policy, then all customers should have access to the same account information through a comparable interface, rather than one that is intentionally set up to confuse and manipulate the customer.

I have contacted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Federal Trade Commission because your company is reporting me 30 days past due from the {$450.00} membership fee that was placed on my account in XX/XX/2020. 

When I initially applied for this card, the {$450.00} fee was automatically going to be taken out with the checking account information I provided during the application process. I even contacted Citi and was told that no minimum was due at the time, NOT even the internal membership fee. 

This is not a true representation of my payment history as I did not spend one penny on this account before your company reported me 30 days past due. This is against my consumer rights to report information based off a fee that Citi applied to this account. Especially, when this was scheduled to be paid when I applied for this card. 

Your company CAN NOT report me 30 days past due! I was never informed by your company of ANY membership fee that was going to be applied when the card opened. How can your company report a fee on this account when XXXX NEVER used it. How can your company report me 30 days past due when I never used the card?

"I financed my vehicle through Wells Fargo Dealer Services. This is was a {$14000.00} loan originated in XXXX XXXX, current balance in {$4800.00} or so. 

The loan is under XXXX XXXX, number XXXX. 

For some impossible to find reason, Wells Fargo increased my monthly payment from about {$240.00} to almost $ XXXX. Please be advised that my monthly statements only show the payment amount, but nothing about the source and breakdown of the payment. 

There was no documentation whatsoever as of why this was increased. I called Wells Fargo several times and finally got someone extremely rude who stated that since they were unable to verify my insurance information - and they added their own insurance to my premium. 

This is when the nightmare started ( about 2 months ago ). I provided Well Fargo with my policy insurance number and told them that the vehicle has never been uninsured. We switched policies ( from XXXX XXXX to XXXX ) about 10 months ago. The vehicle has been insured continuously, with the required collision and comprehensive options. 

I was told that I can not submit the declarations page and proof of insurance myself and that Wells Fargo will take care of it and remove the bogus charges. 

As of today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) I have called and spoke to at least XXXX account reps, XXXX more useless than the other. Every time I call I have to explain from A-Z that my car is and was ALWAYS insured, and that we changed providers 10+ months ago, and that there was XXXX correspondence from Wells Fargo ( written, emails, phone calls, etc ) to address this issue. 

Everytime the reps 'promise ' me that they will rectify the issue and issue refunds for all my overpayments. This never happened, therefore, I will stop making payments and seek legal action against Wells Fargo asap. 

I find it despicable that what is supposed to be a reputable business ( Wells Fargo ) treats its paying customers like garbage and demonstrates unbelievable incompetence. All reps I spoke to were rude, condescending and 0 help. I must mention that I was always polite and nice ( recorded conversations can prove my point ). 


Bottom line is : my car has been insured since the day I bought it. It is fully covered as of today, by XXXX policy # XXXX ( effect XXXX to XXXX ), with the required collision/comprehensive coverages and Wells Fargo listed as the finance company. 

I offered several times to fax/email/mail declarations pages going back to XXXX ( even for when I had XXXX XXXX ) and ran into brick walls. 

I demand that all my overpayments be credited to my account, along with statements that actually detail what the payments are for ( breakdown - principal, interest and illegally added insurance ). 

Until this matter is resolved, I will stop making any payments. Should any negative information be posted on my credit file, I plan on suing Well Fargo and forwarding an open complaint letter to all media outlets and my state consumer protection office. 

I believe what Wells Fargo is doing in not only morally wrong, but also highly illegal - as there is no paper trail they can use to justify the almost doubling of a fixed payment installment loan. 

Please note that I intend to escalate this matter to the highest level, along with initiating legal action and involving media channels. There is no excuse for this type of behavior from Wells Fargo Dealer Services.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"Dear Legal Department, This credit dispute is being submitted as a new evidence dispute. The accounts that are being disputed, does not belong to me. Below is my sworn statement concerning these credit issues.

It is my sworn statement that I declare under penalty of perjury ( "" under the laws of the United States "" if executed outside of the United States '' ) that the foregoing is true and correct to the best of my knowledge. Further, I certify that I am qualified and authorized to file this dispute. I also understand that knowing and a willful misstatement or omissions of material facts constitutes a federal criminal violation punishable under 18 U.S.C. 1001. Additionally, these misstatements are punishable l1S perjury under 18U.S.C. 1621.

I have filed a report with the Federal Trade Commission, which I have enclosed within this dispute package. I have reached out to all of these creditors and have made them aware that these accounts were fraudulently opened, and they have known this for several months, but have yet to remove these accounts from my credit reports. Some of the creditors have been cooperative and have removed the accounts, but others have refused to remove the fraudulent accounts. Therefore, I have come to you, the credit reporting agencies to resolve these issues. The law says that you must block these accounts while being investigated, and I expect that you will do so. 

I made an attempt to file a police report, but I was informed by my county that it did not constitute as an emergency and that they would not file the report because I didn't have any information on the person who used my information, nor did I know how my information was obtained by this person.

Likewise, these COLLECTION ACCOUNTS are also not mine. None of these belong to me. This means that I was not the person, which  had an account with the original creditor, which has sold these accounts to these collection agencies that are now reporting the debts.

"I have notified XXXX  about two companies that are reporting to my credit file in XX/XX/XXXX alone : 1 ) Meade & Associates : I have disputed this account with XXXX   and Meade & Associates - with Meade and Assoc. sending me an error filled itemized statement as "" validation '' of this alleged {$3100.00} debt. You can take one look at this statement and see that it is broken into two categories, "" debts '' and "" credits ''. I have tried to explain to both XXXX  and Meade & Associates that per last page on the statement sheet the {$3100.00} is in the "" credits '' column. I have asked why I owe that after I had already graduated? The school I went to would not even let you go on to the  next quarter if you owed {$10.00} - let alone three thousand plus and let me graduate, which I did. Per the statement on the last page is the last "" business '' dealing with the school was on XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, seventeen months after I graduated, this mysterious charge comes up for {$3100.00}. However, in the box below the last line item on the last page of the statement is a small box with three totals that all say XXXX. There is no explanation and the {$3100.00} is located in the "" CREDITS '' column. If you look at the first page of the statement on XX/XX/XXXX ( first line item entry ), there is a debit in the amount of {$60.00} for "" Entrance Exam Fee '' - that is money I owe the school. The next item right under that on the same date states "" Payment -Credit Card '' and shows a {$60.00} payment in the CREDITS column - showing that I paid the school that amount of money - IT IS IN THE SAME COLUMN AS THE {$3100.00}. So, I ask - how do I owe this? The last page also shows multiple line items for "" Work Study Earning Payment '' which is where the school hired me to tutor incoming students and my weekly hours X hourly rate went towards my tuition - notice they are in the CREDITS column that would show that this is money that has been credited to the school. I have sent extensive evidence of this to both XXXX   and Meade with an outright refusal to remove this from my credit file. I notified both Meade & Assoc. as well as XXXX  via certified mail and with detailed follow along instructions on this multiple times. 
I have disputed this account with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX - with phone dispute with CSR at XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  which again resulted in being told by Supervisor that XXXX  has not duty to look at this evidence I sent them showing the account is in fact erroneous and invalidated. The Supervisor advised me that I my dispute was sent to Meade and "" verified '' as being mine. I asked how it was verified and could not get a straight answer out of the Supervisor. I advised her that XXXX is in violation of the 15 U.S.C. 1681s ( 2 ) ( b ) - "" Treatment of inaccurate or unverifiable information '' which calls for agency ( XXXX ) to promptly delete the item of information from the file of the consumer. I asked how it could come back as correct when it shows everything explained above? Again, to no meaningful response. Therefore, there was no true investigation of the item by XXXX. This is to be deleted from my credit file in no less than 10 days. I am preparing to exercise my private right of action which allows injured consumers like me to impose fines upon debt collectors like Meade & Associates and credit bureaus such as XXXX  in this case.

Eventually, one of ACS accounts was put back on paid/closed/current status but the other account is still showing delinquent status even when it has been paid and closed. It is not showing the final payment and thus harming my credit.

Considering the information indicating a Fair Credit Reporting Act violation, I need all bankruptcy information currently showing under my social security number to be PERMANENTLY DELETED from my credit report immediately.

"I arrived to XXXX  XXXX  XXXX XXXX 2019, due to a military change of station from XXXX XXXX. Needing transportation to and from work, through XXXX XXXX XXXX, I financed a XXXX  XXXX XXXX for roughly XXXX on or around XXXX XXXX 2019. The loan was scheduled to start XXXX XXXX 2019, or when the loan was finalized. I was on the phone the whole time with XXXX while I was purchasing the vehicle from a XXXX dealership in XXXX XXXX, XXXX. On that day, I set up "" Auto-Pay '' for my loan through XXXX. The process was simple, due to the fact that XXXX was my primary banking institution for about 5 years. They had most of my information on file. That day, I even got my auto insurance from XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX 2019, I was on the phone with XXXX. Reasons ranging from my anxiety to confirm a payment would not be missed, to trying to stay on top of a lot of money coming in and out from the international military move. I recall specifically, discussing the "" auto-pay '' subject. The XXXX representative assured me that I had "" nothing to worry about ''. I was told that my auto-pay was set-up and I have provided all the information and paperwork necessary. I was told that when the loan was started, my auto-pay would kick in. ( This phone call is recorded and on record, it was confirmed by another XXXX representative ) On XXXX XXXX 2019, around XXXX am, I received a call from XXXX informing me that I am 3 payments behind. XXXX XXXX is thirty-six ( 36 ) days past due. At thirty ( 30 ) days past due, XXXX reports late payments to the credit bureau. Any payment determined to be late, accrues a late fee. So, at thirty-six ( 36 ) days past due and just being notified for the first time, my head was spinning. By being notified at thirty-six days past due, I was unable to prevent those penalties. XXXX XXXX was the first time I was notified. Prior to that day, I had received no phone calls, I had received no emails, I had received no postal mail from XXXX regarding the late payments. As soon as I found out I was late on payments, and being short on money from the military move, I made one payment as soon as I could. 

That day, after work, I spent XXXX hours on the phone with XXXX XXXX trying to get to the bottom of everything. I was met with a lot of incompetence and unhelpful representatives. Being transferred from person to person, department to department. Not really ever getting the exact facts on why it took thirty-six days to notify me and why my auto-pay never kicked in. I had XXXX representatives tell me that everything was setup for auto-pay and that it was "" weird '' I was never notified. To people telling me to just pay and it is my fault. I was able to get one person that gave me a little more information on the situation. My phone records show calls to and from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Almost all calls I raised the issue and had to re-explain the situation to every XXXX rep. 

On XXXX XXXX 2019, I was told by a XXXX representative, that the XXXX dealership in XXXX XXXX, XXXX  never sent the proper paperwork required to XXXX for the auto loan to start until XXXX XXXX 2019. According to the XXXX rep, by not sending the paperwork, my auto-pay was never triggered to start when it should have on XXXX XXXX 2019. Same goes for the "" debt notifications ''. How it was explained to me, is that I fell through the cracks. Because I had a loan agreement, I was accruing debt from the auto loan but not having actual debt in XXXX   system. 

Since XXXX XXXX 2019, I called XXXX PLENTY of times to find out what exactly happened. To this day, I still get different stories on what happened. Following the XXXX XXXX phone call, I filed a "" credit dispute form '' through XXXX  website. Weeks later, XXXX responded with a blanket statement, saying they only report what is reflected in their records. Their records have me thirty-six ( 36 ) days past due on three ( 3 ) payments. Nothing about their faulty system and me not knowing I even had a debt. My credit score took a major hit. First time in my life I had late payment ( s ). I had excellent credit and excellent payment history. 

From some of my other calls, it was discovered that the dealership did everything on their end, allegedly, according to XXXX and the dealership. It is still unknown what happened on XXXX XXXX 2019, that finally pinged XXXX  debt department to call me two days later. It was said that the dealership "" cleared '' the check given to them by XXXX for the car on that date. Different XXXX reps and departments say different things. 

On XXXX XXXX 2019, I was told by one XXXX representative, that because of how XXXX  auto loan system is, that even if I had noticed my payments were late or not being paid, I would not have been able to make the payment anyway. Due to the issue with the dealership paperwork. That sounds illegal, for me to owe a debt and not be able to pay that debt in a timely matter, before fees and penalties occur. I had two or three XXXX reps confirm that unjust faulty issue of not being able to pay due to XXXX  inept payment system. One XXXX rep even agreed that it sounds illegal. 

XXXX XXXX 2019, I went to my base legal office for instruction on how to further proceed with this situation. I was told to start with this report and follow-up from there.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"This all started on XX/XX/XXXX I woke up and my PNC Bank account was negative 110.00 due to my car payment. I used money they had left and even had to borrow money to take my account out the negative so I wouldn't be charged an overdraft fee I couldn't afford. The last time I checked my account was XXXX that day just to make sure everything was fine and it was. Next day I get an alert saying my account has been overdrawn and I'm initially confused because I haven't used my card for anything since Saturday and everything processed on Monday so what else could it be. I see I had a negative charge of about XXXX dollars which wouldn't have been a problem cause I would have just added XXXX to my account to bring it back positive again yet I was charged a XXXX overdraft fee on top of the XXXX that I went out my way to avoid the previous day. When I called PNC bank that morning I spoke with a representative that told me the XXXX comes from my car payment but that didn't make any sense because my {$430.00} car payment was processed on Monday which caused my account to be -110 why wasn't the extra XXXX just charged on Monday making my account XXXX and I could have deposited XXXX or more on Monday XXXX instead of -110. So I explain that to the rep and I also explain that I just took my account out the negative the previous day buy depositing money and when I checked my account after work at XXXX my account was fine so what happened overnight that made me negative and charged a fee. At worse I should have been charged XXXX and given a chance to add money to bring my account out the negative but instead I was charged an overdraft fee right away after going to bed thinking my account was fine. The rep seemed to agree and did more research on it and even had to put me on hold for about 10 minutes because even he was confused. When he came back he kept inferring that it was a charge from Monday which I kept explaining why it made no sense from my standpoint and he then later tried to refund the overdraft fee for me but it was declined. He then told me he would have the manager from the overdraft department call later that day of XXXX or tomorrow XXXX. The manager did end up calling me on XXXX early in the afternoon and I explained to the same situation I explained to representative before her who was also way more helpful and she just seemed disinterested. I explained that I took all precautions to make sure my account wasn't negative to avoid a fee and how I'm not able to afford a overdraft fee. She gave me the run around and tried to justify the overdraft fee even after I explained how it didn't make sense and was bogus/unfair, she still didn't take anything I was saying into consideration but instead suggested I keep money in my savings account or apply for a credit card through PNC. At this point I got frustrated and couldn't understand why she make this big of a deal about XXXX dollars and refund me the fee and I just pay the XXXX dollars I needed to pay especially when I made a legitimate case that made way more sense than me being charged an overdraft fee for something that I guess was just partially processed on Monday and made my account negative overnight on Tuesday giving me no chance to fix that before I work up early Tuesday morning at XXXX with a {$36.00} fee. I mentioned I would fight this because PNC does have a recent history of being sued for overdraft fees like this and have 2 recent class action lawsuits against them for this very reason. My mother who also banks with PNC has gotten payouts over 1000 dollars twice due to joining the lawsuit. I have had a fight with PNC is the past just about a year and a half ago and refunded me over 100 dollars in fees. What transpired with me is shady and just down right ridiculous especially when you can see the deposits I made in my transactions to bring account positive. You can see I didn't just let my account go and made an effort and did bring my account back to a positive status until whatever happened Tuesday night/morning. PNC didn't even give me a minute to bring my account out the negative before charging me with a fee. Calls are recorded so if they need to relisten or anything they can cause everything I'm saying is legit and makes no sense you would want to irritate a customer over {$36.00}. I have friends who bank with other banks and work in banking and they never have to go though this to get a fee waived especially when they have a legitimate reason.","Bank account or service, Savings account"
"I was flying back home from XXXX XXXX and due to traffic I arrived to the airport only 45 minutes prior to the flight departure. My reservation was made with XXXX but the first flight out of XXXX XXXX was on XXXX XXXX XXXX that is a partner of XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to accommodate us on the flight or to give us any other option and directed us to call collect XXXX. 

XXXX gave us some flight options that all cost more than the ticket itself slamming XXXX XXXX XXXX for the cost. One lower cost option was to fly the same night and the representative quoted us a total of {$660.00} for our reservation of two. I even confirmed that total amount before giving my VISA card number to be charged. 

A few days after returning to the US I saw two charges of {$660.00} each instead of one. I called XXXX and they were very defensive stating the representative meant {$660.00} per ticket and that is right. I challenged them about the charges but they totally refused to drop one charged and provided some electronic vouchers instead. 

So I turn to my VISA card thru Chase to dispute these charges. What I heard back is that they checked with XXXX and the charges are valid and I have to pay. I resubmitted a new request explaining in detail the circumstances and emphasizing the fact that I did not authorize a second charge of {$660.00} and XXXX should be able to check the recordings of my conversation with their representative. In the end I received another letter from Chase stating that "" While you may have a valid complaint with the merchant, the results of our additional review confirms that the transaction is valid and no billing error occurred on your account ''. There was no details of what exactly they reviewed and how. 

Since these charges were never put on hold while Chase was conducting the investigation I felt that I have to pay them in order to not accrue interest charges. Honestly I feel robbed by Chase VISA card for not supporting me in a charge that i have not authorized. There must be a recording of my conversation with the XXXX agent to prove I am right but neither XXXX or Chase want to pursue that path. Maybe because my card is a XXXX XXXX XXXX Chase VISA card?",Credit card or prepaid card

I used the Marcus system to move & XXXX from the proceeds deposited at her XXXX account over to Marcus in early XXXX ( not sure of exact date ). Around XX/XX/XXXX, I went on-line to check on a transaction I made and found that Marcus had temporarily blocked my access. I called Customer Support and explained the situation. They requested that I send a copy of the Power of Attorney, which I did immediately. They informed me that it would take up to 10 business days to respond. After I did not hear back from Marcus, I again called Customer Support. Each time I called their phone support I was put on hold multiple times as it seems the people who answer the phones are not well trained and constantly have to put you on hold to get instructions from other areas. In any case, I very upset to find that they would not accept the notarized POA that our attorney executed, and that I would need to sign their durable power of attorney. After some debate and escalation, they agreed to send me the forms via XXXX in and a self addressed return envelope so that I could return the forms to their Utah office for review. The forms were Marcus ' Durable Power or Attorney, and an Affidavit and Indemnity of Attorney in Fact. I had to make special arrangements to have a notary come to my mother 's facility and we executed both forms and sent the back to Utah. After several more days, I called Customer Support on XX/XX/XXXX, was put on hold several more times, cut off 2 times after being on hold for about an hour ... each time having to navigate through their automated phone system. Each time I provided all of the required answers for authentication including a secret password. Marcus acknowledged receiving the documents but claimed that there was a problem in that I did not put the account number on the form. I told them that I was not able to obtain the account number because they had blocked my access, and since I opened 3 accounts I intended the POA to refer to all accounts opened in my mothers name. In fact, each time a CD with a different maturity is transacted, there would be a new account number assigned. Then they said they needed a medical form explaining why my mother ( XXXX years old ) could not provide the numbers. I explained again my mother 's condition and what the purpose of a POA is but they did not seem to understand. I requested escalation and they told me that it would take another 2 days until I could speak to someone of authority. All of these conversations were recorded so I know there is a record which would show that I followed all of their instructions. To date, I have not had access to the account for about a month. I am fairly sure that they have broken some laws, not the least, exhibiting atrocious customer service that seems to be manned by under-trained personnel.

"After years of patiently waiting and saving, me and my wife got to a point in which we thought it is time to buy a house, our first house. We informed my friend who happens to be a real estate agent. He told us that he worked for a company called Wembley 's Inc., a XXXX based real estate and mortgage broker company in California. We arranged to sit with Wembley 's CEO XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX, 2016. It this meeting, we expressed our enthusiasm and delivered initial documents inquired by XXXX XXXX. He also ran both of our credits as the first step. He then advised that based on our credit score we are approved for up to {$600000.00} home loan. Next, we started looking for potential houses that would fall within that price range. We saw a lot of houses in months of XXXX. As a first time buyer, there was a lot of questions that I either asked my real estate agent or XXXX XXXX through phone calls or email. I was also researching online to get familiar with the process. From XXXX XXXX on, XXXX XXXX contacted us in different occasions asked for different documents like bank statements ( XXXX/XXXX/16 and XXXX/XXXX/16, XXXX/XXXX/16 ), previous employers information ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ). We finally found our favorite house and placed an offer. Our offer got accepted on XXXX XXXX and we opened escrow the following day on XXXX XXXX, 2016. Since a day before opening our escrow I asked XXXX XXXX to provide my loan interest rate and I told him that I would like to lock the rate as we were getting closer to the XXXX ( XX/XX/XXXX 2016 ). each time he refused to provide me with an answer. I have all our communication documented as I still have all the emails. The night before XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ) we were in XXXX XXXX 's office for some required proceedings and I asked him again to lock my rate, he jokingly said let 's wait to see XXXX XXXX 's win and then we could lock on a better rate. With the result of the XXXX coming out the next day, interest rates started to raise as we all know. It got from rate XXXX to XXXX within a week to ten days! Finally on XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX contacted me on the phone and told me that I have two options : 1- 4.75 % +half a point or 2- 4.5 % +2.5 points ( about {$7000.00} ). I decided to switch to a different lending company. It is very important to know that on XXXX XXXX we were almost halfway through the 45 days escrow window, seller demanding final contingency removal letter while we did not have a loan! 
I contacted another lending company, submitted all required documents on XXXX, and went to their office on XXXX XXXX. Our new loan agent found the best rate for the day in REAL TIME, and he LOCKED the rate after I asked for it in matter of a minute. I signed papers in that one session on Monday and we got the loan approval on Friday, in one week. We had to risk by sending the loan contingency removal document to seller, and then asking him to accept one week extension. Should the seller denies the extension request, and we would have fallen out of escrow pretty easily, losing money and valuable time. 
Next step was involved with formally transferring loan documents from XXXX XXXX to our new loan agent. This was initiated with a formal letter on XXXX XXXX, 2016 with my new loan company. XXXX XXXX delayed the transfer procedure until XXXX XXXX. I wrote in an email my dissatisfaction with his handling my case. He delayed sending bank appraisal result to my new lender which in turn caused us to have an appraisal do-over. 
Due to XXXX XXXX 's negligence and ignorance in listening to our demands, our home loan rate has gone up from 3.875 to 4.375 ( per information obtained from the loan company I ended up working with considering our financial situation, employment history and credit score ). We are now paying {$210.00} more each month due to this rate difference.

( Oil field town. ) After speaking to a loan officer, I was told they were asking for the MAXIMUM amount they could on the home, not neccesarily what my Dad borrowed. Selling this house at their asking price is ludacris. I believe a law was passed in XX/XX/18 stating that they have to agree to let me ( trust holder or beneficiaries in Trust ) sell his house at FAIR MARKET VALUE. Asking for more than he loaned is not only unfair, but lying about the amount we owe is also unfair. No one will tell me what the pay off ( amount of reverse mortgage ) actually was. No one will do an accurate appraisal. No one will return my emails. Complete ridiculous and I'm sure a law is being violated here. I have rights to have complete and full disclosure to all information in order to try to sell and pay off the borrowed amount, not what the bank would like to make.",Mortgage

"I have had a XXXXXXXX XXXX credit store credit card for nearly 5 years. In that time I have never once missed a payment, usually paying off the balance to avoid interest charges. In the last 7 years, I have never once missed a payment on anything ever. 

I set up automatic payments sometime in early XXXX with my XXXXXXXX XXXX card. I had not used my card in a long time and carried a {$0.00} balance and went shopping in XXXX on Black Friday as I do every year. 

For reasons that have never been explained to me, XXXX XXXX credit card failed to make the minimum payment through automatic payments even though I had long ago provided bank account information in order to process payments. 

What's more, I was never once notified about anything regarding a missing payment. I never received an email, letter or phone call alerting me to there being something amiss. 

Then one day in XXXX I was alerted by XXXX, which I subscribe to in order to monitor my credit score and detect and fraudulent activity, there was an issue with my XXXX XXXX card. I was shocked to find I had been flagged with a 30-day late payment. I immediately called XXXX XXXX credit card department to correct the situation. I was told for some reason my payment had not processed even though I assured the representative I had already signed up for automatic payments. 

I was walked through the steps on the phone to ensure with absolute certainty I was signed up for automatic payments and something like this would never happen again. I can only imagine what would have happened and how long this would Because of the error which I am certain was not my fault, I asked XXXX XXXX credit department to issue me a Goodwill Adjustment. I felt I deserved one as up until this point I had never once failed to pay them on time and was confident they would take me payment history into account as well as my stellar history of never missing a payment, much less one as small as {$27.00} in over 7 years, roughly 643 consecutive payments of all my accounts tallied in a row. 

I finally reached someone at the head of the credit department and told unequivocally that they would do nothing for me to resolve the issue and that I was solely to blame for the error. She also imparted to me XXXXXXXX XXXX credit department bears no responsibility to notify their customers if they are late, are not required to send a letter, email or to call anyone in case someone has missed a payment. To me, this seems unconscionable and can only wonder what would have happened and how much worse this circumstance would be had it not been for my subscription to XXXX alerting me to there being an issue. 

I was left feeling very angry about her decision, which she assured me was the final word in this matter and there was nothing I could do about it. I decided to see if I was the only unfortunate person to have this happen. After a quick XXXX search, I found hundreds of complaints by people who were having the same issues I was having their processing automatic payments. Some people being overcharged, others getting hit with 90 late payments on their credit report who hadn't used their card in years. And nearly every single one of the complaints ran into the same stone wall of denial from the credit department, many citing the same lack of professionalism, courtesy, and a coherent explanation as to why they were being overcharged and their credit ruined. 

I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and run peoples credit every day in order to qualify potential renters buyers toward purchasing a new home. I have seen many people lose out on a new apartment because their credit score was marred by collections and late payments. The sole reason I subscribe to XXXX to monitor my credit is so that this never happens to me. 

XXXXXXXX XXXX credit card department and their web page is an absolute mess and I'd welcome any agency to investigate their practices. I have many credit card accounts and never have I ever encountered and bank or lender making such heroic efforts at avoiding all responsibility for their obvious inability to management accounts, but absolutely no concern whatsoever to the peoples lives they affect. 

After reading the endless comments from so many unhappy customers with legitimate concerns dawned me that to corrected their mistake with me would mean to have to take responsibility to all the others. Better to deny any wrongdoing to any lest you open the door to a class action lawsuit. 

This company is engaged in underhanded predatory practices and has a blatant disregard for their mismanagement and negligence and I find it outrageous te need to go through all these hurdles to correct a negative remark on my credit report. They refuse to answer for any of their unforced errors which are negatively affecting the credit of those whose only mistake was wanting to get a good deal on gifts for the holidays and trusting the institution to process the scheduled payments.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"On XX/XX/XXXX I called Sallie Mae and spoke with employee number XXXX ( I did not catch his name at the time ), a loan modification specialist in the loan modification office about being put on a loan repayment plan that would best accommodate for my recent decrease in income due to the Covid 19 Pandemic. We had reached an arrangement that I would be enrolled in the graduated repayment program. As a part of this program, it was expected of me to make a "" good faith payment '' of {$250.00} to start out, and a monthly payment of {$450.00} to be paid on the XXXX of each month. The terms and conditions were read to me over the phone and I approved everything, officially enrolling me in the program. I explicitly asked the specialist while I was still on the phone with him if this would bring my account up to good standing as well as have no negative impact on my credit, to which he assured me that the account would, in fact, be in good standing and that this would in no way affect my credit. Just two days later on XX/XX/XXXX I received my first email stating that my loans were falling into delinquency, followed by more on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX, not to mention the incessant phone calls to not only me but my mother and my grandmother, who are both cosigners on my loans, as well as threatening letters in the mail. It was on XX/XX/XXXX that the "" good faith payment '' was officially taken out of my bank account and paid to the company. On XX/XX/XXXX, however, I received a voicemail from XXXX XXXX at Sallie Mae, stating that he was calling from corporate and that he had a very urgent matter that he needed to discuss with me and that I was to call him back at XXXX. I called the number that evening when I got home from work and was put through to, not XXXX, but a woman ( whose name I unfortunately did not catch at the time ) who explained that her goal was to get my account up to balance. I explained to her that I was on the graduate repayment program and had made the good faith payment, which I had been assured would bring it back up to standing. Upon checking my account, she relayed to me that there had been some complication with my application, though she did not tell me what this was, and that it was resubmitted on XX/XX/XXXX, of which I was not notified nor was my approval given. She apologized profusely, explicitly stating that it was at the fault of Sallie Mae that I was still receiving calls, emails, and letters, and that everything would be taken care of and smoothed out within the next two or three days. This, however, was not the case, as I still continued to receive emails on XXXX and XXXX. It was on XXXX that I actually made my first payment of the {$450.00}, three days earlier than was due, and I received five payment confirmation emails, one for each of my loans. Later that same day, however, I received a threatening email stating that my loans were going to be reported as delinquent to the consumer reporting agencies on XXXX, and a letter stating the same thing came in the mail two days later. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called them to see what happening, as clearly there was some kind of miscommunication happening somewhere that I was not aware of, as I had done everything they had instructed me to do, and yet things had not been taken care of as had been promised on their end. On this call, I spoke with XXXX XXXX, who, once again, informed me that his goal was to help me being my account up to balance, and I let him know everything that had happened in the past month, between the incessant harassment and Sallie Mae not recognizing that I am on this program for reasons unbeknownst to me. He told me that he spoke with a supervisor and was the second person now to let me know that it was an error on the part of Sallie Mae, apologizing and assuring me that everything would be taken care of and updated. I gave him permission to reallocate the funds properly as, for some reason, this had not been done yet, and asked if this would still be going on my credit to which I was told that everything would be retracted. However, it is difficult to trust their word at this point, as the previous two times that I was assured everything had been taken care of and that my account would be brought up to balance, neither were followed through. At this point, I feel harassed even though I have done my due diligence. Thank you for your help with this matter.",Student loan

I recently pulled my credit report from your Bureau and my attorneys and I had a chance to go over my credit report and in amazement, that you have decided to report me 30 days late on this account in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and 60 days late in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX as well as 90 days late in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX I immediately disputed this information with CAPITAL ONE and the results of the investigation came back "" verified ''. Not only was I never late on this account, but according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ), the information furnisher is required to notify me of the insertion of negative listings. Since I have disputed the lates with the creditor, and you obviously "" verified '' them, I am very curious as to what kinds of "" records '' you may have for this alleged account. I am very confident that you are in violation of the ( FCRA ) and ( FCBA ) sections ( 1666, 1666a. 1666b., and 1666c. ) as stated below : 1666. Correction of billing errors ( b ) Billing error ( 4 ) The creditor 's failure to reflect properly on a statement, a payment made by the obligor or a credit issued to the obligor. ( 5 ) A computation error or similar error of an accounting nature of the creditor on a statement. ( 6 ) Failure to transmit the statement required under section 1637 ( b ) of this title to the last address of the obligor which has been disclosed to the creditor, unless that address was furnished less than twenty days before the end of the billing cycle for which the statement is required. ( 7 ) Any other error described in regulations of the Bureau. 1666a. Regulation of credit reports ( a ) Reports by creditor on obligor 's failure to pay amount regarded as billing error After receiving a notice from an obligor as provided in section 1666 ( a ) of this title, a creditor or his agent may not directly or indirectly threaten to report to any person adversely on the obligor 's credit rating or credit standing because of the obligor 's failure to pay the amount indicated by the obligor under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, and such amount may not be reported as delinquent to any third party until the creditor has met the requirements of section 1666 of this title and has allowed the obligor the same number of days ( not less than ten ) thereafter to make payment as is provided under the credit agreement with the obligor for the payment of undisputed amounts. ( b ) Reports by creditor on delinquent amounts in dispute ; notification of obligor of parties notified of delinquency If a creditor receives a further written notice from an obligor that an amount is still in dispute within the time allowed for payment under subsection ( a ) of this section, a creditor may not report to any third party that the amount of the obligor is delinquent because the obligor has failed to pay an amount which he has indicated under section 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) of this title, unless the creditor also reports that the amount is in dispute and, at the same time, notifies the obligor of the name and address of each party to whom the creditor is reporting information concerning the delinquency. ( c ) Reports by creditor of subsequent resolution of delinquent amounts A creditor shall report any subsequent resolution of any delinquencies reported pursuant to subsection ( b ) to the parties to whom such delinquencies were initially reported. 1666b. Timing of payments ( a ) Time to make payments A creditor may not treat a payment on a credit card account under an open end consumer credit plan as late for any purpose, unless the creditor has adopted reasonable procedures designed to ensure that each periodic statement including the information required by section 1637 ( b ) of this title is mailed or delivered to the consumer not later than 21 days before the payment due date. Because I take my credit very seriously, I contacted every name and account that was listed on the report. I was again very shocked by the multiple names, account numbers and figures. Included with this letter, is every letter written to those who have hampered my ability to obtain credit. I believe that any judge that looks over the report would agree that it is a violation of both the FCRA, CCPA and FACTA. The following accounts were listed on your report and I have demanded from them a full accounting and five years worth of records to see if their accounts were in violation of the FAIR CREDIT BILLING ACT ( FCBA ). We also demanded signed contracts, agreements or any legal paperwork that would tie us to the following accounts. Under the FCRA, you are required to conduct an investigation on this account if I request it. I DEMAND to see all 100 % verifiable proof that I was indeed Verifiably late on these accounts and the creditor fulfilled its obligations under ( FCBA 1666 ( a ) ( 2 ) ), As I was never notified of a billing delinquency on my accounts, which the creditor must do under section ( FCBA1666 ( b ) ( 6 ). I DEMAND to see proof that I was mailed my statement to the correct address notifying me of both payment due date and delinquency of payment on the account. If you can not provide 100 % Verifiable proof and proper documentation that the CREDITOR fulfilled its obligations under the ( FCBA ) and ( FCRA ), I therefore demand these late payments be removed from my account or I will be forced to be in contact with the Attorney General of my State and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. I therefore am submitting my written request to you to conduct an investigation. Per the FCRA, you have 30 days to conduct this investigation and respond to my request.

"I need your help immediately. I am an XXXX XXXX and took out a student loan around XXXX for XXXX school. I paid everything on time, and got a good travel XXXX contract and decided to call in XXXX to increase my monthly payments to $ XXXX per month. Instead of increasing it, Wells Fargo DELETED all of it, then reported me to the credit bureaus with fraudulent documents. I was harassed while working in the XXXX, and told I was worthless by the debt collectors. The harassment was very intense. Wells Fargo refused to talk to me, and refused/blocked my ability to log into my account. Due to nepotism, I begged someone in my family who used to work for Wells Fargo and eventually was able to get them to talk to me. Creditors bullied & harassed me until, under severe distress I was manipulated into signing to reconsolidate the loan. They withheld information and gaslit me when I told them this was illegal and the contract was broken by them and it is null and void. I did not want to sign it and I made it clear to them that I did not want to, but I needed the phone calls to stop and I needed my credit score repaired. That is black mail I believe, correct me if I am wrong, Im not a lawyer. ( They had me resign with them saying they would give me a "" good deal '' which is trash ) Then they messed up my payments for about 6 months after that as well, and then I still could not log into my account consistently in XXXX. There had been times years ago, I could log in briefly to view my account, yet I could not adjust my payments or how they were applied. Currently I still have no access to my account, despite calling IT and being put on hold or in circles extensively & speaking with the "" executive branch '' of Wells Fargo. Over the years I call them or pop into a branch wanting someone to deal with it, and nothing ever changes. They have wasted weeks of my time and energy dealing with them. In XXXX, when I had more time to try to tackle this again, I went into my local branch frequently with no outcome. Finally someone gave me a card with a number to call, and they made it sound like it was their clean up team for Wells Fargo. That was mostly a dead end & the worker there never called me like she was supposed to then I found out that they were transferring my loan to a different corporation. I refused the transfer and demanded they give me back all my money from the incident to now. I demanded it get escalated which took me having a phone tantrum to get it escalated to their managers there. They said they would help and resolve the issue and they reported to me it is DOCUMENTED that they had DELETED my payment history before and was send off to the credit bureaus incorrectly. I also have emails from then. I ask them for copies of my notes which they refused unless I have a subpoena. It is my information and my financial livelihood, there needs to be a change in laws around that. They have broken so many laws. I have been trying to talk with them for years and they ignore me. I still am unable to log in to my account. I tried to enter into the class action lawsuit and the email link never worked and when I called they would put my on hold and put me in phone circles. They have broken the Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, they have committed fraud, turned in fraud documents to the debt collections agencies, and the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practice Act and the Fair Credit Reporting Act. They still to this date XXXX/XXXX/XXXX do not allow me to log into my account, I just got off the phone with them again this AM and I was put into a holding pattern by them. I have been unable to pay more than the minimum or ensure it is being applied to the principle how I want, because I have been locked out of my account, I would have had this loan paid off already if I could have accessed my account. Instead, they are bleeding me dry and making gains off my compacted interest and inability to access my account online. Most importantly, the ENTIRE LOAN IS FRAUD and they need to give me my money back. They have also consistently had my incorrect address and phone number even though I have had the same phone number since cell phones came out and I have corrected them countless times about this information. I called WF again this XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to get them to fix my account so I can log in, yet I was put in a holding loop. I want to know what your office do for me today. They may try to transfer the loan on XX/XX/XXXX or shortly after. Best Regards & please respond quickly. Im really stressed and scared.

"Navient has been a problem and I have filed multiple complains about them in the past. 
Navient misallocated payments and steered me through multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans. Then, they started mailing letters to me at a previous address and had the wrong telephone number to reach me. This resulted in mis-allocation of XXXX seperate loans that I was consistently paying ( as was agreed, and they do not dispute ), and hit my credit score hard. When I reached out to them and tried to resolve this issue, they could not pull up my account because they had the wrong address and telephone number on file. 
It took multiple complaints to the CFPB to get them to even communicate with me ( thanks, CFPB ). We worked through this issue, all of the fees that they charged were returned, and I refinanced the student loans with a different servicer. By the way - no issues so far from the new servicer. 
What this complaint is about is the fact that Navient was supposed to expunge my credit report, and they did not. This was their mistake, they acknowledged as much and returned the fees ( on paper ) they had charged me. And yet, I'm still paying for it. I can't call them, because I'm not a customer any longer. Maybe the CFPB can help me expunge my credit report from Navient 's mistake.

"On XX/XX/2020, I contacted Wells Fargo requesting the pay-off balance deducting our escrow account monies for re-finance purposes with another lender. That escrow balance would have reduced our refinanced loan by {$4000.00}. Instead, my refinanced loaned ended up costing/being {$4000.00} incremental to what we anticipated. 

The customer service agent advised me that Wells Fargo does not provide pay-off balances deducting the escrow account balance. However, that the escrow account would be reimbursed separately after the pay-off for the mortgage is received. Further, the escrow monies are not Wells Fargo, they belong to the consumers and that they do not benefit from the escrows. 

I explained to the customer service agent that I never applied for this Wells Fargo Mortgage and that the original lender ( PRMG ) had sold this loan to Wells Fargo. Therefore, I asked if she could send me a copy of the terms and conditions signed by me and the co-borrower agreeing to these terms and conditions. She advised that those terms would have been written and signed to in the original loan with XXXX and she couldn't provide. 

I asked if this was a regulatory requirement or a Wells Fargo policy and the agent responded that Wells Fargo only deducts the escrow amount from the re-financed balance if I were to refinance with Wells Fargo. 

I advised the customer services agent that Wells Fargo is benefiting from this policy/procedure against the protection of the consumers.

"I have been using PayPal services for about a year. Never had problems or charge backs associated with my account. Recently I had some payments go into my account for things I sold. There were standard external holds placed on the payments which is normal. My account was at the time restricted for the 3rd or 4th time demanding I turn in bank statements and business information ect ... The holds on payments are usually released after 21 days and proof of delivery. Three days before a payment was to be released, before it had been delivered, PayPal releases 5 payments into my account which set off an alert in there system according to them and the took the balance of $ XXXX and put it in a reserve in case of disputes or returns. This all happened within minutes. They then started telling me lies about who placed the hold on my account blaming another company and refused to tell me why they did so. After a few weeks of false statements and avoiding my concerns, a customer service agent admitted that the holds were in fact PayPal holds but refused to give me an honest answer why they released the holds early. It is also unheard of for them to release a rather large payment before the item was delivered. They told me many times they didn't have control over the external holds. About 5 days ago another customer service agent then told me that they did release the payments and then held the payments to set up the reserve. The money was never available contradicting the emails I received stating that it was available. The large payment for the item that was not delivered yet was also an item that a refund had been requested for 3 times and was ignored by PayPal. I believe state and federal law say if a return is requested it must be given within 10 days of the request. This is a brief explanation of the events and there is much more about the unfair, unethical and I believe to be illegal actions of PayPal. This was a malicious group of events to take/hold my money. This is there true business model. They take or hold users money to either invest it or lend it to other users. They do little vetting when users sign up to verify there business or identity so users can engage in transactions and acquire balances just so they have a reason to hold the money in the future multiple times. And if you don't provide satisfactory proof of the requests, they may keep the money for 6 months or indefinitely. They are not transparent at all about when and why they may take your money. Like I mentioned above, I never had problems with my account. No charge backs or disputes, I had received payments before of equal amounts with no problems so they had no reason to assume there was risk for my account as they claimed there was. I am sure there have been hundreds if not thousands of users this has happened to in the past. When I contacted the corporate officers I got not one single response. Customer service purposely makes it hard to contact them. When you do through the message system they hand you off to a different agent after every message you send so you have to go through the whole explanation again and again about your concerns. You get absolutely no help. I was willing to try some form of resolution process with escalations department but they only make the same false statements. After telling them they are violating the law by not issuing the refund, they have stopped replying to my messages and emails completely. How a company has gotten away with this for so long is beyond me. There is complaint after complaint after complaint all over the internet and it only gets worse with time. Consumers are not being protected from unethical activities and the horrible code of business conduct they have set up at PayPal. It is a toxic environment for all. They probably pay next to nothing in taxes for the amount of revenue they generate. They provide little benefit to our society besides what little services they offer. I can only hope that someday the world business model will change because its killing us all.","Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service"

"NOTE : I submitted a complaint to Wells Fargo approximately eighteen months ago, but did not submit it through the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. So, Wells Fargo already has copies of documents relevant to this abbreviated complaint, and is aware of the specific details behind each of the consumer protection law violations listed here. 
1. I have been sole title owner of the XXXX home at issue since XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX, my ( then ) spouse decided to refinance the property. For several reasons, I refused to sign the note ( but did sign the mortgage ). Years later, I discovered that the bank had forged my name as grantor on a deed so that my ( now ex- ) spouse ( the grantee ) would appear to have an interest in the property when he signed the loan documents. A Wells Fargo employee notarized the forged signature. 
When my signature was forged and notarized in XXXX, I was in XXXX. I sent the bank proof that I could not have signed the deed, in the form of receipts signed by me as I progressed from XXXX to XXXX and back. 
2. Also, when the mortgage was signed, the notary who later notarized it was not present ; she was the same Wells Fargo employee who had notarized the forged deed. 
3. Additional issues related to the loan process include misrepresentations made to me by Wells Fargo representatives so they could get the loan finalized. 
4. In a XX/XX/XXXX divorce, the property was awarded to me. In XX/XX/XXXX, my ex-husband 's debt to Wells Fargo was discharged in a XXXX bankruptcy court. In XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX the bank sent a letter addressed to him at my XXXX residence, stating that the mortgage loan was in default and that failure to pay the delinquency might result in foreclosure. In response, I contacted Wells Fargo, explaining that my ex-spouse had not lived in XXXX for quite awhile, and that he did not have any interest in the property. Later, I sent the bank documents including copies of relevant deeds, the receipts mentioned above, and domestic relations court entries. I also provided them with a form, prepared by Wells Fargo, in which my ex-husband authorized the bank to discuss the loan with me. 
During the year and one-half after the bank 's first letter, I have tried, in many letters and phone calls, to resolve the issues amicably. However, despite the serious nature of my complaint, Wells Fargo has made no real attempt to resolve the issues.

"I had not used the Credit Card in question for quite some time except to pay off an existing debt, through auto-pay. Once that balance was paid in full I discontinued the use of this card until recently. I made a purchase in the amount of {$300.00}. On the due date of payment ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I processed a dispute of this charge, as indicated on the instructions on the back of my bill ( I should dispute any unauthorized charge if not resolved by the due date ). After I disputed the charge I noticed that an Auto-payment had been processed on the same day. However I never authorized the Credit Card Company to process an Auto-payment in this amount, and this was not the amount I had originally set up Auto-Pay for previously. I called the Credit Card Company and requested that the auto-pay be reversed ( because the disputed charge would be eventually credited back to my credit card account from the institution making the charge ). The representative refused to do so. I asked to speak to a manager. Instead the representative hung up the phone in my face. I immediately documented that conversation in an email to the Credit Card Company, and requested that any bank charges be covered. I called my Bank to STOP PAYMENT on the payment. My bank did as requested. However, the Credit Card Company processed another payment in the same amount, even after I had discontinued Auto-pay. I called the Credit Card Company on XX/XX/XXXX to have the payment reversed. I had to request a manger to have it processed, after the representative misrepresented that the payment had already been credited to my banking account. I was informed it would take 2-3 business days. I indicated that this was unacceptable. However the Manager ( Named XXXX, Id # XXXX ) could not or would not expedite the process of this reversal of payment. Meanwhile the processing of that payment has disrupted my means of payment to other institutions, and caused me to incur a STOP PAYMENT fee of {$30.00}. along with late payment fees on other accounts.

"On XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a letter from Wakefield and Associates. They were attempting to collect a debt from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( shown exactly as listed on the statement ) in the amount on {$740.00} principal balance plus {$30.00} accrued interest at the interest rate of 8 % - totaling {$770.00}. 

I was not familiar with XXXX  but the date of service listed on the statement was XX/XX/XXXX which lined up with medical treatment that I received at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I then contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and inquired about the balance, which I was assured on the phone and in a written statement ( can provide this statement upon request ) that I had a {$0.00} balance due for all services associated with my visit on XX/XX/XXXX. I also contacted my insurance company to inquire about the claims process to see if anything had slipped through the cracks resulting in this unpaid debt. I was assured, again on the phone, that everything associated with treatment received on XX/XX/XXXX had been processed and paid in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was then sent another letter from Wakefield and Associates dated XX/XX/XXXX attempting to collect a total amount of {$780.00}, {$740.00} principal balance and {$47.00} interest for the same debt at XXXX. This letter demanded payment in full because the interest would only continue to grow the longer I waited to pay it. This letter also threatened litigation if the amount was not paid in full, again including added interest charges. 

I sent Wakefield and Associates a letter, via certified mail, asking for validation of the debt so that I could look further into the alleged debt. I received the letter, dated XX/XX/XXXX from Wakefield and Associates. The debt was listed at {$740.00} in the information provided to me.

I then requested a detailed billing statement from XXXX, which can take XXXX to 60 days to process via written request, and I received that statement on XX/XX/XXXX, which lists the debt at {$740.00}. 

I was served a summons XX/XX/XXXX by Wakefield and Associates. The Summons includes an attempt to collect a debt {$790.00}, including {$740.00} principal and {$58.00} in additional interest. The detailed billing statement from XXXX which was provided more than a month after the Summons was served to me, only lists the debt at the principal amount of {$740.00}. This means that Wakefield and Associates is using unfair practices and the violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) by attempting to collect interest not authorized on the original debt with XXXX. 

I am still in contact with the original creditor, XXXX, in order to settle the billing issues that were the result of administrative error. I was not given sufficient time for this process to be resolved before Wakefield and Associates escalated to extreme measures. 

I called XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with their billing department who told me that there was insufficient information, specifically an incorrect address for my insurance and that they would reach out to XXXX XXXX XXXX to get the correct billing address for my insurance, as XXXX XXXX XXXX were able to successfully bill my insurance. The last phone call with the XXXX   billing department on XX/XX/XXXX, I have been told that the issue is currently in the process of being resolved and should take another few weeks to be completely resolved. Payment is being made by my insurance directly to XXXX and I was told on the phone that once payment is received, that they will contact the collections company to stop collection measures on the debt. 

Wakefield and Associates has used Unfair Practices to attempt to collect interest that was not authorized in the original debt agreement on 3 separate occasions, threatened litigation if I did not pay their bill in full including the unlawfully additional interest charges and continues to violate my rights by attempting to schedule mediation services with a private mediator that was not mutually agreed upon which was part of the mediation order issued by the court. Medical billing and insurance are extremely complicated and slow moving processes that require time to resolve.

She also said that the check of over 10,000 would not cover any past due amounts I.e. what we havent paid since our car was totaled. I asked why and she got frustrated with me, not understanding my actual question which was simply why wouldnt the insurance check cover the past due amount and kept telling me GAP doesnt cover past due amounts, which was not what I was asking. I tried to explain my question to her and she told me I wouldnt get anywhere with this conversation if I kept talking over her. 

I asked for her supervisor, whos name was XXXX, who then got on the phone and explained she saw nothing wrong with the conversation on her end, as she sits next to XXXX XXXX and didnt hear her get loud. I asked the same questions, which werent answered by the supervisor either. Who also became rude with me. I asked to be removed from the call list, saying that I would prefer to deal with this on my own than be treated poorly by debt collectors who wont answer my questions, or even try to understand them. She then said that we wouldnt be able to be called by the GAP insurance either and we would have to contact them. 

All in all I still have no answers, not to why they havent received a check that was sent to them a month ago, or why Im being held responsible for payments that were after the date of the car being totaled, or why the check from the insurance cant cover those payments.","Consumer loan, Vehicle loan or lease, Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan"

"I have an issue with my Barclay credit card where, there were some unauthorized charges to the credit card which have been place under review/dispute.

I have communicated my concern with the Bank and they have advice me to pay all interest and late fee charges as they would not be able to control whats been reported to the credit bureau and waive any additional fees. The bank also ensures that when the investigation is over that they will credit my account with all the fees but would not be able to update the credit report ( meaning the late payments will show in my credit report as valid. ).

Long story short, ( XX/XX/2017 & XX/XX/XXXX   ) their website payment and email system had many flaws. Emails would indicate that a payments are over due. I would visit their site to make a payment, but no where on the site would it indicate an amount, nor would it indicate which loan was due. I have many loans with FedLoan from school. So I would make a payment so that I could at least make some payment so I wouldn't impact my credit, I still continued to receive emails saying I owed money. So I called to see if I could get a consolidation so that I could get a single payment with no confusion. The representative said he would pause payments until he could get approvals for me to get a consolidation. And that if I saw credit late notices on my credit to disregard them and that it will eventually get removed. Well, they never got removed, nor did they seem to want to remove them ( "" Its a late payment regardless is the response i got '' ). So I decided to get automatically payments setup so that I didn't have to deal with these problems. Now I have all these late payments in my history and it's destroying my life. I can not get a mortgage or any other benefits because of what Fedloan services have done to me. I have contacted the Federal Student Aid office to have this investigated.

"Dear CFPB, Please find my complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX and Blitt & Gaines PC. for illegal collection of debt I do not owe, specially to XXXX XXXX XXXX, racket, unjust enrichment, lies to Federal Authorities, Ponzi Scheme and other crimes. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX Blitt & Gaines submitted me a partial respond to my Debt Validation request - such as copies of monthly statements which are purportedly belong to their purported client, XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I demanded additional validation, in particular to provide me a copy of Retainer agreement for Blitt & Gaines from XXXX XXXX XXXX  ; copy of my WRITTEN agreement where I agree to pay any debt to XXXX XXXX XXXX ; proof that my WRITTEN Agreement is properly recorded with XXXX XXXX XXXX as an asset on their accounting ledger ; and validate that this was an actual debt and not the payment to me for participation in XXXX XXXX XXXX Ponzi scheme with derivatives operated by XXXX ( member of Federal Reserve ) and their co-conspirators, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I also specifically requested to verify which method used XXXX XXXX XXXX to hire Blitt & Gaines lawyers ; and how they communicate. 

If this communication is conducted via cloud server or any other website, please identify the website or a web platform. 

Blitt and Gaines refused to provide me requested information and resorted to evasive statements that Blitt & Gaines was retained by XXXX XXXX XXXX to collect this debt - while XXXX XXXX XXXX never confirmed this retention ; and here is no single document in support to Blitt and Gaines statement that they are retained by XXXX XXXX XXXX. Evasive and incomplete respond under IL and Federal law is not a respond at all. 

Blitt and Gaines submitted false statements that their records indicate that on XX/XX/XXXX Ms. XXXX opened a credit card account with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

First, the ACCOUNT referred by Blitt & Gaines was a concealed agreement with me to perform financial services aka issue Promissory Note which will be used by Federal Reserve ( where XXXX is a member ) 's member XXXX XXXX XXXX to issue derivatives where the sole beneficiary is XXXX XXXX XXXX, via book entry system which they sell to investors for at least 12 times more than the payment given to me for SERVICES. 

Blitt & Gaines confirmed that Prior to our representation ( without any proof of such representation ), XXXX XXXX XXXX received two validation requests from Ms. XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sent MsXXXX XXXX validation of the account as evidenced in the attached documentation. XXXX XXXX XXXX  NEVER answered my demand to VALIDATE the debt ; and never responded how my SIGNED application was handled by XXXX XXXX XXXX, as well as a proof that this WRITTEN document was recorded as an asset on XXXX XXXX XXXX ledger. 

On XX/XX/XXXX our office sent MsXXXX XXXX our initial communication indicating our representation and providing the required information pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. 

Once again, Blitt & Gaines only VERBALLY indicated their retainer with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Blitt & Gaines can claim that they are retained by Santa Claus, I need to see the actual PROOF of retainer and the name of the person at XXXX XXXX XXXX who is responsible for communication with Blitt and Gaines and who handles BOA accounts receivable. None of it was provided. 

This complaint is the only communication we have received from Ms. XXXX. In response, our office mailed verification of the account as requested, which included fourteen months of billing statements evidencing the balance on the account. 

Blitt & Gaines again resorted to evasive and incomplete respond. I did not asked to provide me evidence of a balance, I need evidence of the ACTUAL account as recorded in XXXX XXXX XXXX ledger, pursuant to GAAP. Evasive and incomplete respond is not the respond at all, under IL and Federal laws. 

Blitt & gaines further lied to Federal authority that a credit Card is an unwritten Agreement. 
IF they were lawyers and not racketeers, they must be familiar with IL law which states that ( 815 ILCS 160/2 ) ( from Ch. 17, par. 7102 ) Sec. 2. Credit agreements to be in writing. A debtor may not maintain an action on or in any way related to a credit agreement unless the credit agreement is in writing, expresses an agreement or commitment to lend money or extend credit or delay or forbear repayment of money, sets forth the relevant terms and conditions, and is signed by the creditor and the debtor. 

In other words, Blitt and Gaines falsely claimed that a credit card is an unwritten agreement. 

XXXX and XXXX NEVER responded to my question about securitization of my personal information by ANYONE, but particularly by XXXX XXXX XXXX who just recently was sued Over Credit Card Debt when Customers file a class action lawsuit over banks credit card debt collection. The suit alleges that BoA sued customers for unpaid credit card debt on debts that were securitized. These debts were sold, assigned, or transferred to a trust via credit card securitization, a financial move that resulted in BoA relinquishing its debt obligation. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  was brought by XXXX XXXX XXXX and was filed on XX/XX/XXXX in XXXX Eastern District. The case alleges that BoA violated the Pennsylvania Fair Credit Extension Uniformity Act and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. It requests BoA pay punitive, actual, treble, and statutory damages along with injunctive and declaratory relief, attorneys fees, the costs of suits, and other relief. 

If XXXX XXXX XXXX and Blitt & Gaines will continue its illegal practices ( aka racket ) and refuse to provide me royalties from trades conducted by XXXX XXXX XXXX and other undisclosed parties ( particularly XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX ), ect - I will not hesitate to move for legal protection via a major Class Action for racket, identity theft and unjust enrichment Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , IL XXXX",Debt collection

"I rescinded a my mortgage loan after the lender refused to remedy material disclosures ( the fees associated with my mortgage XXXX they above what the law allows, in the timeframe allowed to them by law. 
There were several Truth In Lending Act violations regarding the material disclosures associated with my mortgage.

These material disclosures were in sections A and B of both the Loan Estimate ( s ) and the Closing Disclosure ( s ).

The Truth In Lending Act requires a lender review and cure all tolerance violations within 60 days of consummation of the loan. Further, law requires the lender cure any Truth In Lending Act tolerance violations prior to the borrower bringing it to their attention. 
This lender 's first tolerance cure check, left uncashed, was issued 492 days after consummation of the transaction, as defined by signing of the binding agreement ( s ). 
This lender 's second tolerance cure check, left uncashed, was issued 787 days after the consummation of the transaction, as defined by signing of the binding agreement ( s ). 
I rescinded the loan after the lender 's first unlawful cure attempt and before their second unlawful cure attempt. 
There is no mortgage, yet this lender has filed for foreclosure on my home with the intent to sell it. The lender did not unwind the transaction, rather they hired a law firm to entice me into a settlement agreement. When that failed, they hired another law firm to foreclose on my home. 
Both law firms were advised of the rescission delivered to this lender in XX/XX/XXXX. 
It is unlawful to collect on a debt that doesn't exist. 
This is my 3rd complaint to the CFBP about this lender, in each phase of the progression of the issue. Once complaining about the origination the loan.

I know the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act very well. I know the Truth In Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Integrated Disclosure ( TRID ) rules very well. And, while this transaction was originated in the Optional Compliance phase between the XXXX implementation and XXXX compliance dates, the material disclosures would have been out of compliance for both.

"On or about  XX/XX/XXXX , I received mail from the gas company BP. It looked like replacement credit cards for me and my wife. I have had a BP gasoline card for about 30 years along with cards from a few other gas companies. This card looked a little different in color and I was puzzled by the Visa logo on the from of the card. I looked at my existing BP card and it does not expire until  XX/XX/XXXX  which was more puzzling as to why they sent a card a year in advance. After looking over the material in the envelope I relealized they sent me a general Visa credit card which I did not ask for.

I called the number on the sticker on the card ( page 1 in the attachment ) and got to an operator who was trying to get me to give her personal information like SSN and phone numbers and I stopped talked to her. I hung up. I pulled one of the cards off of the letter and underneath was a different phone number cleverly hidden under the card ( page 2 in the attachment ). I again got a person trying to get personal information from me. I insisted on speaking to a supervisor and was transferred to a gentleman several minutes later. Upon pressing him about what I received and why. He told me that BP sent out a credit card offer with a OPT-OUT provision. This was incredible. I told him I get a ton of credit card offers in the mail and routinely shred them to protect my credit and never heard of this. I explained how upset I was at this deception and got very little support from him. I told him this was fraud and the credit card could have gotten into the wrong hands and since I was not expecting this it could have created a big problem.",Credit card or prepaid card

"Starting on the evening of Friday, XX/XX/XXXX through Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to go online and call Homepoint Financial to make my mortgage payment for XXXX. The online system did not recognize my account number after multiple attempts. The automated system kept looping around and never went to the point where I could choose the option so I could make my payment over the phone. I attempted to reach someone at Homepoint on Saturday XX/XX/XXXX and Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX via phone and sent and email through their website expressing my inability to make my payment online or over the phone. I never received a reply back from Homepoint. Finally one Sunday, XX/XX/XXXX I was able to log on to my account online, but the system kept putting my payment date as XX/XX/XXXX which was incorrect. I did not make my payment at that time since the date was incorrect. I called Homepoint first thing in the morning on XX/XX/XXXX and explained my delemia to and what occurred over the last few days. They explained that they had been closed over the holiday and took my payment over the phone. I was told that unfortunately I would be reported the credit bureaus for having a late payment and that it was my responsibility to know that they were closed over the previous days. I informed them at that time that I would put in writing what occurred so I could have this removed from my credit report since they were having a problem with their system. I monitor my credit on a monthly basis and the next time my credit report was updated it reflected a late payment on my account with Homepoint Financial, so I put in writing what occurred and sent letters to all credit reporting agencies and to Homepoint Financial. I never received a response back from my email or my letter to Homepoint. I did receive a response back form XXXX  and XXXX, but I didn't get a response back from XXXX  either. XXXX did remove the negative reporting from my credit report but XXXX did not. I call Homepoint to inquire as to why they never responded back to me and they said I needed to send them another letter with a copy of my credit report to them and someone would get back to me. I made a second attempt to contact them to try and resolve the issue over the phone and spoke with XXXX XXXX in the resolution department on Monday XX/XX/XXXX and explained to her what occurred and she said she would speak to her supervisor and explain what occurred and they should remove the negative reporting. She advised me she would call me back within 48 hours. She never called me back so I called her back on XXXX XXXX and left messages, she never returned my calls. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX I called her back again and she answered the phone and informed me that they were not going to remove the negative reporting from my credit report. During this time I did receive a refund from Homepoint for my late fee in the amount of {$98.00} which I never requested, I only requested for this to be removed from my credit report, I owed them the {$98.00}.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"1st conversation with Midland - Date Unknown The representative from Midland Credit Management called explained that I had a debt from XXXX in excess of {$2000.00} and that they wanted to settle the account. I asked them to mail me proof and to give me payment options if everything checked out. They explained that they were n't going to mail me anything and that the only payment they could take was over the phone via debit or credit. I told them that I would not ever give them any of my account info but I would be willing to mail a cashier 's check if the debt was real and if they were who they said they were. They said that they could not accept payment in this fashion and could only take debit/credit. They then threatened me with a lawyer. I told them if they want anything from me, they need to mail me a verification of the debt, then I hung up. 

XXXX/XXXX/16 I spoke with XXXX XXXX from Midland Credit Management. He, again, explained that I had a debt of over {$2000.00} to XXXX and that he was a debt collector trying to resolve the debt. I explained that I had reviewed my credit report and the charge off, according to my credit report, was under {$1000.00} and that I would like written explanation about the debt that I owed along with proof that he is who he says he is. An account manager got on the phone and told me that all of this could be handled with conversation and that they had already mailed an explanation of debt to my old address ; one I had not lived at since the end of XXXX, 2016. I asked that she mail another explanation of the debt to my new address so I could have it in writing. She said that she would not be able to do that because their system would n't allow them to resend letters. She then went on to explain that time was not on my side and that the debt would be turned over to an attorney. I told her to go ahead and do that. 

XXXX/XXXX/16 I spoke with an individual who did not identify himself but did say he was from Midland Credit Management. He called trying to collect a debt on a XXXX XXXX account. He also said that he is trying to avoid the account being turned over to an attorney. I explained that I spoke with someone in XXXX and requested that a letter be sent to me explaining the debt and for conformation purposes that they are who they say they are. The gentleman explained that they had no record that they had ever spoken with me. He also gave me the same story that they could not send a letter or fax one to me because they have already sent two, none of which came to me.

"XXXX XXXX was highly deceptive with his practices in securing a mortgage for our family. Since XX/XX/XXXX I kept asking if he needed more information related to my business account and continually kept telling me that everything was fine. On XX/XX/XXXX I received from advisors mortgage a pre qualified letter with a loan amount of {$630000.00} with a {$32000.00} down payment. After speaking with XXXX over about increasing the loan and getting the secured paperwork for his office I spent {$330.00} to properly pull all the relevant paperwork necessary on the property we were securing a loan for. I had to tell him to do it. That pre approval letter was completely worthless. Had a made an offer and gone to a closing it would have never closed. 

That suggestion came from a knowledgable third party who immediately questioned XXXX 's ethics and knowledge along with the actions of Mortgage Advisors. He explained to me that they should have already done this and that they should be looking closely at my business which I own as part of the loan. Since I'm a XXXX XXXX XXXX individual the lending institutions look at your income and debt ratio 's differently in determining the total loan. He believed the pre-qualification letter was inaccurate and that we would never be able to close. XXXX was clueless, unprofessional and should not be working with anyone trying to secure a mortgage. Mortgage advisors stance on it and lack of any training or attention to details needed in securing an actual closing loan is scary at best. 

His negligence cost us the opportunity to at very least secure a rental unit that building putting our family at risk since our lease is ending soon. XXXX knew all along that timing was a major factor in getting this done right. The reason I sought him out in the first place was through trusted source and I needed a professional. XXXX was continually making excuses as to giving me the proper information in a timely manner. He constantly pushed dates he said all along he would either have things done by or conference/phone calls. 

I finally questioned what he had done in completely destroying any reasonable loan on XX/XX/XXXX. He told me after I continued to find out what the status of the loan amount was so I could put in proper offers told me he had a meeting at XXXX at a coffee shop after being 4 days late and another half hour late for our conference call. His associate from Mortgage Advisors XXXX ( No last name given ) essentially told me I have no viable loan finally after continued questioning. XXXX said they wanted a years worth of business bank statement, my name de-authorized from several credit cards in my wife 's name and my wife off the loan. I provided to them immediately the bank statements. In attempting to get answers about the credit cards they never followed and ignored 3 emails on XX/XX/XXXX. This happens all on the day that XXXX says we are going to be ready to go and it looks great all along. In questioning him about why he didn't get this information together prior his response was to say lets move forward and he should have it in a few days. I explained to him again that I'm out of time and need to have concrete dates and answers from him and XXXX. They just said I was high priority for the office. It was obvious to me I had made a huge mistake believing his office and him. It was one lie after another and the office goes along with the big show they put on all the while it's a waste of time. 

They put my family in huge bind as a result of their negligence. We all knew it was not an easy loan and if they had done their jobs properly this would never have happened. If I had known this weeks ago I would just taken the rental which are very tough to come by in this building and dealt with the purchase in a year. I offered a very substantial co-signer which he said we don't need over and over again. 

He then sent me a text message saying "" I would go to another mortgage broker ASAP '' because of me questioning his negligence. He clearly was uncomfortable with me questioning him and XXXX about their negligence in handling the loan correctly. XXXX was well aware of my time line, was already over a week late and had full access to any documents he needed which I repeatedly offered. It was only until XX/XX/XXXX that the truth came out. His and his offices way of dealing with the issue was to ignore all requests for additional actions. They also refused to release my own credit report to me citing "" privacy laws ''. I'm not sure if that's true or just another way to make my mortgage application issues more difficult in spiteful manner. I've had to have my credit pulled again as result of his and their offices actions with an real professional. 

XXXX XXXX who I spoke to at their offices about the incident then backed by telling me after all the time and money spent that we should mutually part ways and that his office never received documents. That is a lie. I continually was pushing XXXX to do his job and explained on XX/XX/XXXX and would quickly get him anything he asked for which I did when he asked of it. He is dangerous to anyone trying to secure their loan. XXXX 's way of dealing with what he and said was "" The highest priority '' was to go home early on XX/XX/XXXX and head out on vacation.This after he said he was calling me back right away. He never called me back and ignored several emails. He emailed me saying he went on vacation. That certainly isn't the actions of a reputable manager who says he's working to help fix the issues his office and XXXX XXXX said. That's someone who knew they failed completely to follow what are the proper steps in getting a mortgage and then cut me loose when they were questioned why. 

What they did instead of informing me of the issues, keeping me in the loop and asking for the proper documents needed to secure the loan is string me along and then drop my family the minute I complained. They simply didn't want to hear they had completely mismanaged and wasted a month and half 's worth of time I didn't have. They also put my wife and XXXX small children at risk being that our lease ends in XXXX and XXXX XXXX knew it on day one that spoke to him. 

Something needs to be done to restrict, fine and/or bar them from doing this to other families. Who knows they may already done so and I have no idea what other improper actions they may or may not have taken. It's clear thought that the general attitude of this company is to have no compassion, care or professionalism in what they do. I've never written a complaint like this in my life nor am I seeking any money.",Mortgage

I had subsequent tests, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, the following week. My point in telling you this, is all those hospital bills and testing bills were paid in full by my insurance XXXX. I have all the personal identification numbers, etc, if this is something you require later. I never received an ambulance bill from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Pa. XXXX ( XXXX ) XXXX ext XXXX "" XXXX ''. Yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, a debt collection agency contacted me. Commercial Acceptance Company at XXXX. XXXX has been very helpful, polite, professional with my case. Tells me I have a delinquent bill of {$2000.00}. I ask what the billing is for, my credit score is  XXXX, I pay my bills, I 'm a XXXX XXXX and I worked hard to establish credit. The bill is from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX service. XXXX at Commercial Acceptance gave me all the information so I could start making phone calls.If this is not rectified by XX/XX/XXXX, it damages my credit report as a bad debt. She also put a hold on the accruing interest. The Ambulance bill is {$1400.00}. The collection fee is {$370.00} with the interest to date of {$130.00} for a total of {$510.00} in fees. That will not increase, as I the interest has stopped. First thing I do is call my insurance, XXXX XXXX. Always nice, always helpful. They never received the bill either from XXXX XXXX. Every other bill from the hospital was paid in a normal timely fashion. If I had seen a bill, I would have addressed it, if my insurance had received it, they would have paid the bill. Next I called the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I spoke to XXXX. The address, phone numbers, and insurance company for billing for me were all incorrect. This is where this issue starts. I asked where they got that information, upon delivering me to the emergency room they go to the hospital information desk, and take the my previous patient information. I have not been to that hospital since I was born, which was 22 years ago. I politely asked why they do n't verify that information, XXXX XXXX answer was "" the ambulance ca n't stay, it 's how we do it, and it happens all the time ''. At that point I gave her all the correct insurance information, along with correct contact information. I understand the ambulance ca n't stay, and if this happens often, my thinking is you need a new system, which I did not say, she was polite, and going to "" check into it ''. I also asked if I should call XXXX XXXX which is where they incorrectly sent the ambulance bill. XXXX was adamant, no. I thought that was odd. The next day, since this has me very concerned, XX/XX/XXXX, I started calling to double check things were corrected, and we were working towards resolving this. I called the collection agency, Commercial Acceptance first. Yesterday I gave them my correct insurance information, I wanted to confirm they indeed contacted XXXX XXXX, XXXX confirmed it was done. I called my insurance company XXXX XXXX to update them. I then called XXXX XXXX to double check if they had the information and were submitting the billing for services rendered on XX/XX/XXXX.  I asked XXXX to repeat something, as I was taking notes. This seemed to upset her, and she asked why I was taking notes. I told her I am just trying to keep all the case facts correct to try to rectify this issue. I told her I did contact the incorrect insurance company XXXX XXXX XXXX they billed and I have the denial of service explanation of benefits, dated XX/XX/XXXX, addressed to them, which XXXX states she never received. She also stated she never received any "" undeliverable, not known, unable to forward '' returned bills sent to the incorrect address with my name. She also stated she did not have contact with the collection agency yesterday, when they did indeed confirm contact. At this point, she just became irate and belligerent. Loudly explained to me, "" it has only been 1 day, I have n't had the chance to speak to my office manager, these things take time ''. Well, they took the time to have a collection agency call me? I am working very hard to not have this effect my credit score, when all of this is not my fault, I remained polite, asked to speak to the office manager, I was told she was on another line. I said I would wait, XXXX stated it was going to be a long wait. I asked if the office manage would call me back, XXXX said yes, and terminated the call. I called back to ask if she wanted my phone number. I was on the phone with my insurance company when the office manager called back, she left an equally belligerent message. I called her back, unprofessional, rude, and condescending.And, I could not get her to give me her name. Now. The only thing I am trying to do here, is pay a bill that I, and my insurance company never saw. I guarantee, if either of us had received the bill, it would have been paid. If I have a bill, it gets paid, end of story .I do not want my credit score damaged which is what they are threatening me with for the extra {$510.00} in fees. This ambulance company, who acknowledged to making the mistakes, is in no hurry to make this right.

"At first xoom by XXXX had exciting prospects for me. I needed to transfer money to myself internationally. Once I made my first transaction I was contacted by xoom stating they needed my ID and a bank statement from my source account in order to complete the transaction. After providing my California ID I provided screen shots of my online bank account and affidavit. I was told that id was verified. however the affidavit and screenshots of my source bank account was not. Despite most financial institutions finding the supporting documentation sufficient, I was told a pdf file of my bank statement was need. As such a statement was not available for the current source bank account, I asked if it were possible to provide a new source bank account in which such a statement I could provide. The representative said that was absolutely fine.all I would need to do is make a new transaction using the new source bank account and provide that new source bank account '' s statement. As such, I did just that. I followed up and was told that the information can not be verified. This makes no sense as I submitted and official ID and bank account statement. All that was required for verification. When speaking with customer service no one seems to know what is going on. They claim they are not allowed to be transparent. 

My concern is that I provided my private information for the intended purpose o the transfer. After providing the two private documents necessary for verification, the company collected my private personal information and still did not allow me to proceed with the service such private information was intended for.

It's been so long, and I finally read the verbiage used in the disclosure about overdraft fees and they say they will pay things to their discretion. I have called them to ask them not to take the fees if the fees aren't in there. This is not my primary account and I am switching to an account that doesn't take money if the money isn't in there. If paying something is up to the discretion of a company, they will pay it because they know I'm going to pay hundreds of dollars in overdraft fees every single year for it. With that said, I have tried closing my account multiple times now and they tell me that I can't if I have pending transactions. So then I have to wait. In the meantime, another thing ( to their discretion ) is paid, and another fee is attached to it! I don't even use the account anymore, and I feel like I'm being cornered.

"A person, or a hacker-criminal posing as a person, broke-hacked into my online bank account, on two separate occasions, posed as me ( or my husband ) and drained our accounts and tried to obtain large cash advances from our VISA card. The bank restored our money, and is investigating the issue ... .and we are not entitled to know anything further. WHY? If someone physically assaulted me and took me to an ATM machine and made me withdraw lots of money at gunpoint, the police would get involved, try to catch the person, the person would be apprehended, and a legal proceeding would ensue ... .Why is this level of scrutiny and closure not afforded victims of financial crimes? 

The first time this happened, on XXXX/XXXX/15, the credit union insisted that it was ME that got hacked, not the institution itself. The second time it happened, the credit union took it a bit more seriously but still maintains that my account being hacked is a separate situation from the credit union 's 'back office ' systems being hacked. 
I say this is an INSIDE JOB. How does someone ... .a ) get my access code, and my password ; b ) log into my on-line bank account ; c ) create a third party transfer record to allow the transfer of funds to another credit union member ( whose names I do know ) d ) log into my account and transfer money to the newly created 3rd party transfer record ... then open my visa account and try to get a cash advance of {$15000.00}?

Yes, the bank is investigating ... .but how do I press charges? 
Also, the first time the hacker helped him or herself to our money, said-hacker went into our account and defined a third party transfer record so that money could be transferred from our account to another credit union member 's account. An automated email was generated to notify us that this 3rd party transfer record had been created, and that if we did n't create the record we should call the bank. Well ... .hacker hacked in at XXXX, moved the money to another valid account ( i.e. depleted our account ), we saw the email at noon, just two hours later, but alas it was too late to prevent the thief from stealing the money. Why, oh, why would n't there be an approval process on setting up a third party transfer record? Why would the bank tell us that just 6 months earlier such a control existed and that before a 3rd party transfer account could be 'authorized-for-use ' it had to be approved from a source outside the on-line account?

"I have had my checking account with Regions Bank for quite some time now, maybe 6 months, and I have always done everything to safeguard my personal information and pin number from theft.

In the AFFIDAVIT, I specifically stated that I believed that my ex-girlfriend and her brother might have taken my PIN number, more so her than him, because she lived with me, and although I NEVER told her where my PIN number and debit card were located, she WAS my girlfriend and it s conceivable that she could have searched throughout all pairs of my pants in my closet, found the pin number, and could have been watching me enter the code to my safe.

This is all a lie of course, because I specifically stated in my AFFIDAVIT that my ex-girlfriend and her brother might have been the ones who stole this from me.

I want my money and if I do not get it soon, I'm going to take the bank to small claims court.

"Complaint : I'm complaining against Experian. They are an impossible company to communicate with when there is an issue. I've tried contacting them for two days ( 8.1 and 8.2 ) and there is only an automated phone service with very few options available that don't match my needs. Background : A few days ago I applied for a credit card and was stunned that I was not approved. I have a good credit score and have always been responsible with my credit. I also make good money. I started getting nervous because my information was part of the XXXX XXXX breach of 100,000 customers and I was part of the Experian breach recently, too. I'm worried that fraudulent activity had occurred with my information. I found out that a credit card I applied for used Experian as their agency to check my credit status and decide whether to give me a credit account or not. So, I went directly to the Experian website to sign up for {$1.00} credit report. I tried about 8 different times to create an account and buy my report. ( I'm terrified of identify theft! ). However, each time I filled out information, the system failed and screen popped up that said, "" We are unable to verify your identity. '' Therefore, I couldn't access my report. How can this be? I entered my Social Security number, my address, my credit card info to buy the report, and they can't identify me? What more do they want? Then, I was really paranoid of ID theft. So, now, I can't speak to anyone about my current credit report from an agency that manages my credit report to see IF THERE'S FRAUD?!! This makes no sense.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

"In XXXX I filed Ch XXXX and Wells Fargo was my mortgage holder.

WF used the contractual due dates of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and applied the payments to months that were part of the pre and post petition arrears instead of applying to the Post Due Date as agreed in the CO and SA. These payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX. Then on XX/XX/XXXX WF again paid the XX/XX/XXXX Pre petition payment with funds from the {$4500.00} arrears payment made by the Trustee. The remainder of the {$4500.00} was set into an unapplied status. On XX/XX/XXXX WF paid XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX again with money from the unapplied funds in an attempt to comply with a Notice of Cure sent to WF by the Trustee. They paid the XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX mortgages again when those months had already been paid mistakenly using Trustee monthly payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. They continued to pay the months that were included in the SA and CO with monies sent for the current post petition due dates until XXXX XXXX. 

WF used unapplied funds in the amount of {$340.00} on XX/XX/XXXX to make a partial payment to my account. I mistakenly counted it as XXXX XXXX payment. I realize that money was actually the principal payments for XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX XXXX that was never applied correctly.

WF never waived the interest as the SA and CO instructed and even though they filed a Response to the Notice of Cure XX/XX/XXXX saying all monies had been received, WF says I owe them over {$1300.00} in arrears.

"Apple Card ( Goldman Sachs ) continues sending me statements with a balance that does not make sense, even after I closed the account and paid the amount that THEY told me was the total balance in full. In other words, the balance is more than the net sum of credits and debits. They seem to have messed up and installment purchase at the XXXX XXXX. In any case, even after paying the total final balance in full - more than I thought i owed -- they are still saying it's not done. 

This started in XXXX and after I got a statement that was impossible to understand. The math didn't ' add up -- by their own admission. I talked to 3 different reps and none could solve it. After one call in XXXX that lasted 2 hours -- I finally agreed to pay of the entire thing including the installment purchase in full and close the account. Even though the total seemed too high and didn't make sense. I wanted to be done with it. So I sent payment on XX/XX/XXXX and the account was closed. 

Now, 2 months later I am being sent emails saying I owe more. So today, Sunday, I spent 2 more hours on the phone with a rep. We went through transaction by transaction and it showed I had paid MORE than the total of my expenses. ( Each bill was paid in full each month - other than the 0 % interest installment purchase at the XXXX XXXX ). So this has nothing to do with accumulated interest charges. I paid the bill in full each month. 

She was very helpful but even she couldn't figure it out. By her own admission it didn't make sense. She went to get a supervisor - and I end up on endless hold. And after another hour of waiting on the call, she never came back and abandoned the call. So no resolutions. 

I would be willing to pay the balance they say I owe - {$130.00} if I thought it would go away and end the matter. But that is what I did in XXXX and that didn't work. I am quite sure that I could send the {$130.00} and next month I would be asked for more.

"My mortgage was with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Once I mentioned HARP to them, the loan was transferred to Seterus Inc. The principal balance was carried over along with two alleged late payment fees which could not be reconciled or verified as valid by Seterus. These alleged late fees were from the following months according to Seterus documents I received : XX/XX/XXXX for {$36.00} XX/XX/XXXX for {$36.00} After that, Seterus added an additional late fee of their own on XX/XX/XXXX for {$36.00} The total for these fees was {$100.00} There was another additional fee allegedly brought over from XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$9.00} and Seterus added another fee in XX/XX/XXXX for {$15.00} for an unverifiable drive-by inspection which I did not approve or authorize. Seterus chose to have this service performed so they are responsible for the cost of the unnecessary service. If they chose to purchase my mortgage and decided they needed a drive-by inspection then that is their cost of doing business ; not mine. 

At this point the total fees that were on my account was {$130.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Seterus sent me a letter stating that if I made a payment to cover the 3 late fees listed above by XX/XX/XXXX, the total amount due for these late fees would be reduced by 50 %. The total for the 3 fees was {$100.00} and 50 % would be {$54.00}. 
I made this payment along with a {$10.00} telephone payment fee and received a confirmation letter from Seterus dated XX/XX/XXXX. 

If all accounting at Seterus were done correctly, the fee total on my account should have went from a total of {$130.00} down to {$24.00} as broken down below : Total Fees = {$130.00} subtract My payment of {$54.00} subtract Seterus 50 % reduction agreement {$54.00} Remaining balance = {$24.00} However, my very next statement showed my payment of {$54.00} but Seterus never removed the other 50 % as part of their agreement if paid by XX/XX/XXXX. 
This is obvious since my fee balance was {$79.00} which is {$130.00} minus the {$54.00} I paid. 

This immediately displays the lack of administrative documentation at Seterus. If this wasn't bad enough, Seterus then again sent me a letter on XX/XX/XXXX with an identical type offer concerning late fees again. 

This time, the same late fees that were included on the first letter referenced above were again still showing as outstanding but minus the {$54.00} I had already paid. So instead of my late fee total being at {$0.00} from the prior payment, the 50 % reduction was never performed by Seterus. In addition, Seterus added 2 more late fees on in the amount of {$36.00} each for XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. 

So now my fee total was up to {$120.00} which is the {$54.00} which was never removed by XXXX, plus the two additional fees of XXXX. Once again, the letter stated that if I paid by XX/XX/XXXX, this amount would be reduced by 50 % so I would only owe {$63.00}. 

It is very obvious that the accounting practices at Seterus are very questionable. When I called to ask about this second letter, I was told that the fees included late fees from XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. XXXX should have already been removed with the payment associated with the first letter however their lack of accounting quality assurance and control, allowed it to be added back into my balance. 

During this call I was also told that Seterus uses the "" processed '' date when determining whether a payment is late. They do not use the date that they "" receive '' the payment which I believe is legally required. The Seterus rep also informed me that Seterus does not have the capability of documenting the date a payment is received. I have signed postal service delivery receipts showing payments were "" received '' by Seterus within the grace period permitted however Seterus still charges late fees because the payment was not "" processed '' until after this grace period expired. If it is not illegal to charge late fees based on the date the payment was processed, then it surely has to be illegal to continue to demand payment for a late fee when it was already supposed to have been removed based on an agreement Seterus made to me. 

I honestly believe Seterus does this with the hopes people won't be diligent enough to check their statements and the math. When I again called Seterus to point out these mistakes, the rep on the phone could not do the math to even admit to a mistake being made. She also said it was impossible to transfer me to anyone who works with the loans because the loan people were not trained to receive phone calls. I was told I would have to submit a letter asking for a review. How ridiculous is it that you can not talk to someone on the phone to clarify and correct an error made by their people. 

I had submitted a complaint through CFPB awhile ago demanding these late fees be removed from my account since I was able to supply the USPS signed delivery receipts for all the payments that Seterus claimed were late. Seterus had agreed to remove these fees but to date they still have not been removed. 

This company acts like they are above and beyond the laws of this land mostly because I believe they feel nothing will ever get done to them. If they get caught, they say they will correct the problem and remove errors but they never do. Nobody forces them to do it so they just keep on doing business as usual. This is one company that deserves a major audit and investigation by the US Government. 

My next step will be to contact my local Congressmen to urge for an investigation. This is my third complaint against this company and I have all the documentation to show their unethical and most likely illegal accounting techniques. The absolute refusal of this company to allow any phone conversations with loan managers is a disgrace and outrage. Someone needs to close the doors to this company or fine them so heavily that they will not be able to continue to operate in this way.",Mortgage

"Capital One Auto Finance reports that they were included in my bankruptcy. More importantly, they state in the Comments section of my XXXX report : BANKRUPTCY CHAPTER XXXX, BANKRUPTCY DISCHARGED. This suggests that I discharged my debt to them in my bankruptcy, which I did not. My account was always in good standing and on time throughout my loan. I tried calling about this today and the Capital One automated system said they could not help me, then disconnected. 

I had to include my Capital One auto loan account in my bankruptcy as a matter of procedure. In reality, I filed a DEBTOR 'S STATEMENT OF INTENTION on XX/XX/XXXX as part of my bankruptcy, meaning I was keeping and purchasing my car and continuing to pay Capital One. I did indeed pay off my loan early to Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. Secondary confirmation of payoff : Capital One misquoted my payoff amount and had to send me a follow-up letter and refund check on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Why is Capital One allowed to suggest that I was a bad account with this reporting and language, when I was always a good account, and since they were not adversely affected by my bankruptcy? Capital One should not be allowed to place a derogatory report on my credit report when they had ZERO loss. Punishing good accounts seems a very bad business practice for Capital One.","Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports"

A loan with AmeriSave was applied for on XX/XX/XXXX. Throughout the course of the loan application, the loan has not been processed properly and in a timely fashion. AmeriSave employees are not serving us as customers, but are instead nonresponsive to requests for information. At points in time, it appears that AmeriSave will actually process the loan, going through motions of new loan disclosures, then closing disclosures and requests for payoff figures of existing mortgages. The closing disclosures have not had the loan amount we requested or the previously offered terms. Then there are delays in responses and new issues that they request to be resolved. We have now experienced this cycle twice. 
Initial terms offered are included in the emails of XX/XX/XXXX ( Attachments Email XXXX - Initial Quotes.pdf ; Email XXXX - Initial Closing Costs.pdf ). The loan offered had lower points than our local financial institutions offered for the same interest rate for a cash-out refinance, so we decided to go with AmeriSave for our refinance. 
All information that was requested from us was completed same or next day, with the exception of our pension verification letters, which took a week to get and then upload. 
Early in the process, the loan originators business phone had static and was hard to hear. He instructed me to call his cell phone when contacting him for a better connection. Upon research of the communication between myself and the loan originator, the company will not have record of all of my calls to the loan originator. Additionally, when I have emailed a question or information request, the responses are delayed for days or weeks. For some questions, I have never received a response. 
Updated loan or closing disclosures have been posted to the my.amerisave.com portal with "" new '' figures which are usually wrong. Reasons given for the changes at the end of the document state "" customer request, '' when I have not requested any changes. 
The initial loan application ( Attachment Amerisave Initial Mortgage Documents XXXX.pdf ) provided for a loan amount of {$310000.00}, interest rate of 2.75 % and points of {$2000.00}. We had previously been told our rate would be locked, but noticed it was a float rate. We discussed this with XXXX XXXX, Loan Originator, who said not to be concerned, and our rate would be 2.75 %. 
It took a month for our home appraisal to be scheduled. We received our home appraisal report on XX/XX/XXXX, valuing our home at {$430000.00}. This put our loan at a 72.7 % loan to value ratio, allowing for the terms we had been offered. If the home value to loan ratio had changed to over 75 % or 80 %, the loan terms would have been changed at each 5 % increment. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating a loan disclosure was placed in our portal ( Attachment Loan disclosure_XXXX XXXXpdf ). The loan amount had been increased to {$320000.00}. I emailed the loan originator stating what we wanted included in our loan resulting in a lower loan amount than had been stated in the loan disclosure and asked if my figures were an accurate understanding of what our loan would be. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I did receive an email verifying that they understood I wanted to pay prepaids ( insurance and taxes ) out of pocket. I was then provided with the amounts that would be required as prepaids to place in our escrow account ( Attachment Email XXXX Finally Received Actual Figures for What Is Needed For Escrow.pdf ). I had been told in phone conversation by the loan originator that even though it showed six months being escrowed on the loan disclosures and application, AmeriSave would actually only require two months taxes and insurance as prepaids for the escrow account. The insurance amount is six months and the taxes were 4.77 months of prepaid. With nine months before taxes would be due again, this would allow for an extra {$2000.00} to be held in the escrow account and not needed to pay taxes. The decision was made to not escrow taxes and insurance, and I asked the loan originator and processor to refigure my loan details. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, another loan disclosure was placed in our portal ( Attachment Loan disclosure_XXXX ( 1 ) XXXXpdf ). This disclosure still valued the home at {$450000.00} instead of {$430000.00} as stated on the appraisal that had come in eight or more days earlier. The mortgage amount was now listed at {$310000.00}, due in part to our request to not escrow taxes and insurance or include prepaids in the loan amount. The loan originator also told me on the phone that we were now getting lender credits. I do not recall what he said the loan credits would be or the date of the phone conversation, but the XX/XX/XXXX loan disclosure shows a lender credit of {$920.00} and no Discount ( points XXXX. In addition to our home value, there are incorrect figures listed. For our present First Mortgage on page 2, it is {$1100.00}, not {$670.00}. On page 3, the XXXX XXXX is a vehicle loan that was paid off when it was refinanced to XXXX in early to mid XXXX. The new loan has fewer months to payoff and is {$510.00} per month. 
We next heard from AmeriSave on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting a break down on our income and we replied next day. ( Attachment Email XXXX - Request for Income Data.pdf ) I have a voicemail message from the loan processor that our loan was pending final approval on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attachment AmeriSave Voicemail XXXX ). I received an email from the loan processor on XX/XX/XXXX, stating in part, Your Closing Disclosure is complete and ready for you to review, you must review and acknowledge this document 3 days ( not including Sunday or Holidays ) prior to your actual closing date. You may access this document by clicking on the following secured link ( Attachment Email XXXX First Incorrect Closing Disclosure and Response with Questions.pdf ). The loan amount, interest rate, and loan costs had been changed ( Attachment ClosingDisclosure_XXXX.pdf ). Here is a summary of the pertinent differences between the initial Closing Disclosure XXXX and Loan Disclosure XXXX and Loan Disclosure of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Page 2 Loan amount changed to {$350000.00}. It was {$310000.00}. 
Interest rate changed to 2.875 %. It was 2.75 %. 
Monthly Payment changed to {$1400.00}. It was {$1200.00}. 
Page 3 Lender Credits changed to {$710.00}. It was {$920.00} The unrequested increase of the mortgage loan amount increased the loan to value ratio resulting in a higher interest rate and lower lender credits. 
I emailed the loan originator and processor regarding the incorrect changes, was told by the loan processor that only the loan originator could change these back. Subsequently, another loan disclosure ( Attachment Loan Disclosure XXXXpdf ) was posted to my portal, and it appears to be very similar to the XX/XX/XXXX loan disclosure. However, the incorrect closing disclosure remained posted as well. I expected that the figures would be corrected and that the loan would close in three days since I had received the three-day notice of closing disclosure. 
After XX/XX/XXXX, I repeatedly asked for an update on the status of our loan application, usually resulting in no response for days or weeks. Some responses were that I would receive information at the end of a particular day. More often than not, no information was received by the stated date, prompting additional emails requesting updates. I was asked for additional documentation of income and there was a posting in the portal to finish my loan application. Both tasks were completed same day as requested. Both tasks should have been requested much earlier in the process. ( See Attachments Email XXXX - Response to Incorrect Closing Disclosure Questions.pdf ; Email XXXX to XXXX - Status Inquiry - Express Concern for Payoff Letter Fees.pdf ; Email XXXX Status Request - Statement by XXXX  XXXX To Extend Rate Lock ) In the XX/XX/XXXX email exchange, you will find I expressed concern that the rate lock was expiring and the statement by loan originator XXXX XXXX that he would extend and take care of that for you so no worries. 
Having not heard anything since XX/XX/XXXX, I sent additional status request ( Attachment Email XXXX - Status Request.pdf ) I received a reply that our loan was stuck in the system. Additional information on income was needed. I found this perplexing as we had previously received a closing disclosure that would indicate we would close the loan. I replied to the request and asked for a response. ( See attachment Email XXXX - Application Stuck in System, Request for Additional Information & Reply.pdf ) I did not receive a response to my XX/XX/XXXX email reply to XXXX XXXX, processor, so emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX with detailed statements requesting to know if the income information I provided was sufficient, if they needed more information, and I began requesting time frame for processing of our loan application, which now had been in process for almost a full three months ( Attachment Email XXXX - Status Request, Notify Unhappy with Loan Processing.pdf ). I also expressed my dissatisfaction with the service I was receiving. 
I called AmeriSaves customer service phone number during business hours on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, and the message stated that I would receive a call back the same business day. I also sent a detailed email expressing my concerns to AmeriSaves customer service email address on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attachment Email XXXX To Customer Service - Unsatisfactory Processing of Loan Request.pdf ). I did not receive a call back or an email reply. 
I emailed a request for an update again on XX/XX/XXXX. At this time, I began including the customer service email in addition to the loan originator and processor on my emails. I did hear back from the loan originator stating I would hear something by the end of business that day, however, I did not receive information by the stated time. ( See attachment Email XXXX to XXXX - Status Update Requests and Responses.pdf ) I again emailed all three parties on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX., and did not receive a reply. The loan originator emailed back on XX/XX/XXXX stating that there would be a resolution that day. I did not hear back from the loan originator. 
During this lengthy process, I have checked my portal at my.amerisave.com almost daily. On XX/XX/XXXX, I found a task to complete. The upload was not working properly and this exchange of emails documents assistance with the task ( Attachment Email XXXX - Additional Financial Data Requested.pdf ). During this email exchange I also received a reply from a person in customer service. I began including her on emails sent to AmeriSave employees. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email stating that our loan was approved to close. A time was set for the traveling notary to come to our home to sign documents ( Attachment Email XXXX - Approved to Close, Set Notary Appointment Time.pdf ). As it was late in the day, I downloaded the closing disclosure the following morning. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, after reviewing the closing disclosure, I emailed all parties providing information that the loan amount and terms were not as requested and previously promised. This was now the second incorrect closing disclosure we received ( reference XX/XX/XXXX ). ( See attachment Email XXXX - Incorrect Values on Closing Disclosure.pdf ). 
I did not receive a reply to my XX/XX/XXXX email, so emailed again on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attachment Email XXXX Loan # XXXX Complaint - No Response to Email Regarding Incorrect Figures.pdf ) In this email I ask why I did not receive an answer to my previous two emails, notified all parties of my dissatisfaction with the loan process, that I had already filed a claim with the XXXX of Georgia XXXX and that I would file a complaint with the CFPB if they did not process the loan I have requested or refund my {$500.00}. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by another AmeriSave employee, XXXX XXXX, who stated she was filling in for XXXX XXXX who could not load documents onto her computer because of the storm. XXXX verified the loan amount we are requesting. She called me back in the evening of XX/XX/XXXX and stated that our debt-to-income ratio was 58 % for the loan we want. This was why XXXX XXXX had increased our loan amount and added a payoff of our automobile loan and credit card balances to the closing disclosure. When I calculate our debt-to-income ratio, it is around 30 %. I requested the figures that they used to come up with the 58 % debt to income ratio ( Attachment Email XXXX - Request for Figures Used to Determine Income to Debt Ratio.pdf ). I did not receive a response. In regard to our debt-to-income ratio, we were approved for our home equity loan with XXXX XXXX in XXXX being similarly situated in our debt and income levels. The loan we are requesting would lower our current debt to income ratio. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, as I did not receive a response to my XX/XX/XXXX email, I emailed asking if they were including my vehicle loan twice in determining my monthly debt ( Attachment Email XXXX - Debt to Income Ratio Question, Loan # XXXXpdf ). In reviewing the loan disclosures, it looked like this might be a possibility. I did not receive a reply. 
We are now in the stage where I stated that the loan amount and terms were not as requested and previously promised, no replies are received, consequently, closing documents are not adjusted and no closing occurs. This happened after the XX/XX/XXXX closing disclosure was received and now after the receipt of the XX/XX/XXXX closing disclosure. 
AmeriSave has repeatedly changed the loan amount we requested to a higher amount. This results in a higher interest rate and/or higher discount points and/or lower lender credits depending on what time frame we look at during this process. 
AmeriSave has repeatedly asked for income verification in various forms over the past four months, all of which was readily available whenever it was asked for. It seems to this applicant that the income verification is spread out over the course of the process so that they can say we dont qualify, lengthen the time for processing the loan, then approve the loan at a different, higher amount. It is curious that the loan amount is increased over the amount initially requested and a clear to close on this higher loan amount is received, yet we do not qualify for a lower loan amount. Paying off the vehicle loan and other credit card balances is not on the XX/XX/XXXX closing disclosure, yet XXXX XXXX stated that it was necessary to qualify for the closing disclosure received XX/XX/XXXX. Both closing disclosures have the same loan amount. It seems that AmeriSave is attempting to get us to use additional equity that we have built up in our home to give them a larger mortgage than we want, resulting in a higher interest rate and lower lender credits. 
An additional note : Our home equity loan is with XXXX XXXX. For each email/fax request for a payoff letter, they charge {$30.00}. During the processing of our loan application, there have been five requests for an email/fax payoff letter. These occurred on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Fees for payoff letters attached to our account now total {$150.00}. The XX/XX/XXXX request was done by me at the request of the loan originator XXXX XXXX. He said that the account holder was typically able to get the payoff letters faster than their company. This statement doesnt seem to hold water since they were able to get an additional four payoff letters emailed/faxed to them without my assistance. Additionally, after talking with XXXX XXXX, we rescinded our authorization ( Attachment Rescission of Borrowers ' Certification & Authorization to Release Loan Information XXXX.pdf ) for XXXX  XXXX, the closing company, to request information on our current loans in hopes of not incurring additional fees for payoff letters for a loan that is not correct and, consequently, doesnt close. In my phone conversation with XXXX XXXX on this issue, I was told that they do not and will not remove these fees. We, of course, are able to secure payoff letters should it become needed in the future. 
Further, it appears that our loan could have closed on XX/XX/XXXX as evidenced by the closing disclosure we received. The new loan as requested would have a payment of {$1200.00} per month for principal and interest ( Attachment Loan Disclosure XXXXpdf ). Our existing loans are {$1100.00} for our mortgage and {$670.00} for our home equity loan, totaling XXXX for principal and interest. The difference is {$590.00} per month ( {$19.00} per day ) which we would be saving in home loan expenses each month.",Mortgage

All other installment loans such as Mortgage, Auto and other installment loans have all been paid on time as agreed or paid off sooner. I have only applied for and obtained credit as needed. After following all of the purposed recommendations my credit score still remains well below XXXX. My score seems to bounce back and forth in the low to hi XXXX 's. I would not have had to Bankrupt in the first place had our Government been in control of our Mortgage & Banking Lending Practices. The Housing Market would not have come to a complete CRASH had our Government put into place Strict Regulations to prevent Appraisers from preparing false Housing values, Our Government continues to fail to Regulate the Banking Industries Lending Practices and it appears that we are heading right back into another Recession. As for my own personal Credit score. It  appears that all three of the Credit Reporting Agencies are creating a false and very Low Unrealistic Credit Score. This has become very obvious based on my credit history since Bankruptcy. I believe they are doing this so that Lenders will not offer me the best credit available and instead these Bureaus are creating the scenario that forces me to pay higher interest rates and fees. Most importantly Experian Credit Report is what Credit Check Score is basing my Credit Score from. So I ask you again how can I improve my credit score to over XXXX? It is obvious that I pay all of my payments on time, keep all credit cards balance paid off every month and have done everything suggested by Credit Score as well as Experian. I am frustrated by the constant interference by the Credit Reporting Agencies and their low intentional Credit Scoring that is designed to force me the Consumer from obtaining the best credit available.

"Follow-up Compliant with New info to BofA 's Response dated XX/XX/XXXX : This complaint continues the original complaint filed # XXXX. BofA is compelled to retract my loan based upon wrongful Service Release Transfer ( SRT ) while the file was under Appeal, and while being investigated by the Office of President which resulted in the discovery of errors in the 1 ) transferring process, file was in fact NPV positive, had cleared all its exclusions and was pending an offer. The retraction is also based on that the fact that Successor Servicer has confirmed they are a non-participating DOJ servicer. ( XXXX letter XX/XX/XXXX ) XXXX XXXX, with regards to your XX/XX/XXXX letter, while I recognize the difficult role you have in relaying bad news to homeowners, I also recognize BofA 's obligation to comply with DOJ, regardless of time, to comply by correcting the errors and provide the "" solution '' that was pending prior to SRT. The Appeal enumerated specific input fields that created a default or system conflict. The appeal resulted in discovering, material and systemic errors that wrongly decline qualified homeowners. While your CFPB response only states "" At the time service transfer, there was no approved loan modification agreement. Any communication regarding a modification after the service release transfer date was in error. '' This is a case, whose sole responsibility rests with BofA. Clearly, any investigation by the OTP after Service Transfer can not be disregarded as someone 's error .Your research shows to the contrary as there are copious notes in the homesaver system that confirm NPV positive, that my file had cleared all its exclusions in XX/XX/XXXX, and a modification was in fact in your system but withheld due to SRT. The Appeal was handled by XXXX XXXX ' office, Senior V.P. of Foreclosues, OTP and assigned to XXXX XXXX, Unit Manager of OTP, XXXX high excutives. Dismissing their investigation and any resulting communications after the SRT is not a valid or defendable position.Frankly, it shows the importance OTP placed on rectifying this error and concerns of the ramifications BofA could face from these systemic errors affecting other files. As for the issue of transferring : the file was under Appeal and although the transferring of loans is allowable under the terms of the Deed of Trust, as your letter indicates, the DOJ Stipulated Judgment ( SJ ) obligates both the servicer and successor servicer to continue with the modification. Since XXXX has clearly claimed "" XXXX is not included as participating servicer of XXXX '', this is not possible and a violation of the SJ and its intended protection offer to homeowner. Therefor BofA has an obligation to retract the loan from XXXX and comply with DOJ. As evident in the transcript XXXX states in reference to the NPV runs "" there were XXXX. The XXXX one failed, the XXXX one failed, you appealed the XXXX one. The XXXX one um, was a pass that generated a solution. And then, the XXXX one is a fail because it was service released. '' This admission along with a note on XXXX in the homesaver system that states "" NPV failure code XXXX, causing the loan to be declined '' causes me to question BofA 's proper implementation of NPV. On a separate phone conv. on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX stated, that XXXX XXXX directed him to intervene, not just for my file, but for others that had been denied for the same errors.I believe this was the driving motivation for this investigation.

"When I filed out my Income-Based Repayment ( IBR ) for 2018, I went to the student aid government website but somehow got redirected to my fedloan website. FedLoan is 1 of  my 2 loan servicer 's. I filled out my IBR on fedloan.org, instead of the federal student aid website. I had never done that before and did not realize American Education Services ( AES ) didnt get my IBR. AES also did not have the correct contact information for me, even though I have had the same telephone number for over 15 years. Once I finally realized the mistake, I filed out my IBR for AES. Usually when I fill out my IBR, my current balance decreases, or is zerod out. With my other loan servicer FedLoan it decreased b/cthey immediately applied a forbearance to the outstanding amount owed before my IBR was processed. However, AES my 2nd loan servicer never applied the forbearance and let that large amount carry over each month. I noticed it was being carried over, but in the past it has taken a few months for that decrease to show up on my bill. I also recently noticed they were charging me a {$40.00} late fee as well, even though I was making my IBR payments on time. After receiving several bills with the large balance, I just went ahead & paid it in full. In the meantime, I had been making my IBR payments on-time every month. Currently, AES has reported me to all 3 credit bureaus as being over 180 days late even though I have been making my IBR payments every month on-time. 
I sent American Education Services a letter only requesting that they change my late status to all 3 credit agencies as on-time, however they denied my request. When I looked back at my online bills I noticed the late fees AES was charging me. I believe they never applied the forbearance and have no desire to work with borrowers so they can scam more money out of people. The late fee is almost {$40.00} a month. I was being charged {$40.00} a month for 8 months even though I was making my IBR payments on time. FedLoan servicing received my IBR, applied my forbearance and I have had no issues what so ever.

It didnt make sense to me at the time but upon reviewing my recent credit report I see that capital one reported my account as delinquent virtually destroying my credit score. They clearly sought a way to remove themselves from the personal loan and caused me personal harm in the process. After seeing the impact to my credit I Immediately contacted capital one to learn they claim my XXXX payment was late because I didnt make the minimum payment. I advised them my payments were always made online through their platform including the final payment to pay the balance. They stated I should not have relied on the minimum monthly payment reflected on line as that could have been inaccurate. In fact they state I paid an incorrect amount prior month ( despite what was stated as the minimum payment online ) which caused a portion of the unpaid amount to carryover from month to month unknown to me. The customer service representative informed me the capital one online banking system was not where we want them to be and that I should not have relied on the minimum payment amount reflected on their system. Why am I being held accountable for a flaw in their online banking system and frankly I now believe this was simply an attempt for capital one to close personal loan accounts through their own admission they no longer want to offer. They want off of these loans now and have undertake questionable business practices to do so. When you call capital one XXXX customer service number the pre recorded message now states capital one is no longer offering personal loans. These are deceptive practices by capital one with intent to elimate loans and create adverse credit impact for its customers. I have challenged this through credit agencies with no success and sent email to Capital One CEO and his executive team and did not receive a single response. The documentation provided by capital one to credit agencies claims a late payment but the specific individual months never reflect an overdue amount.
